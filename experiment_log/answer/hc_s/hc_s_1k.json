      "Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."

It does not address the ELS contract, which is summarized separately in Table 1. The report references other Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports that discuss funding approaches such as traditional full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations.  \n\nA key challenge in assessing MYP savings, as highlighted by a 2012 briefing from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), is the difficulty of comparing actual costs against hypothetical alternative acquisition paths. The report outlines stringent requirements for entering into multiyear contracts, emphasizing the need for congressional oversight and detailed justification.  \n\n**Key Requirements for Multiyear Contracts:**  \n1. **Presidential and Congressional Authorization:** Requests for multiyear contracts must include detailed terms, conditions, and a cost analysis by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE).  \n2. **Secretary of Defense Certification:** The Secretary must certify, at least 30 days before contract execution, that statutory conditions are met, including cost savings, stable design, and funding feasibility. Exceptions are allowed under \"exceptional circumstances\" with proper justification.  \n3. **Delegation Limits:** Certification authority cannot be delegated below the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  \n\n**Flexibility and Reporting:**  \n- Contracts may include options to adjust quantities and must account for potential funding cancellations.  \n- Agencies must notify Congress 30 days before awarding such contracts and submit detailed reports on obligational authority and procurement account impacts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report underscores the complexity of multiyear contracting, balancing potential savings with rigorous oversight to ensure accountability. It highlights the need for transparency, particularly when deviations from expected savings occur, requiring presidential intervention to seek congressional relief.  \n\n(Word count: ~300; fits one page when formatted appropriately.)",

      "The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Federal Land Acquisition and Disposal Authorities**  \n\nThis report outlines the diverse authorities granted to four federal agencies for acquiring and disposing of land, highlighting significant variations in their powers. Congress has enacted laws over more than a century to govern these actions, often addressing specific parcels through legislation. For example, Title XXX of P.L. 113-291 included provisions for land transactions, while other laws expedite acquisitions or permit conveyances below fair market value to meet public priorities.  \n\nRecent Congresses have debated the scope of federal land ownership, with proposals such as requiring the sale of a percentage of lands annually or mandating offsetting sales when new land is acquired. Funding for acquisitions, primarily through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), fluctuates yearly, with appropriations varying significantly since 1965. The use of proceeds from land sales has also been contentious, prompting congressional debate.  \n\nThe Secretary of the Interior and the National Park Service (NPS) have specific responsibilities for potential additions to the National Park System, including studying and reporting on new areas and updating boundary proposals in management plans. The Secretary must also submit triennial reports to Congress on authorized but unacquired lands. Disposal of NPS land is restricted, with major boundary reductions requiring congressional approval.  \n\nThe **Weeks Act** and the **1983 Small Tracts Act** provide additional authorities, allowing boundary modifications for the National Forest System (NFS) and the sale or exchange of small land parcels. Proceeds from such sales are often earmarked for further acquisitions, with larger sales (exceeding 2,500 acres) subject to congressional review. Notably, the **Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998** has generated significant revenue, with 85% of proceeds funding land acquisitions and projects in Nevada.  \n\nIn summary, federal land management involves complex, agency-specific authorities shaped by evolving legislation, funding decisions, and congressional oversight. Disposal and acquisition processes reflect a balance between public needs, conservation goals, and fiscal considerations.",

      "The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-578) created the LWCF in the Treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program—State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of the total appropriation for other purposes since FY1998."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Report**  \n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 was established to support outdoor recreation resources through federal and state initiatives. Authorized to receive $900 million annually from oil and gas royalties, motorboat fuel taxes, and surplus property sales, the LWCF’s funds are only accessible if appropriated by Congress. Historically, appropriations have been allocated to three main purposes: federal land acquisition, state matching grants, and \"other purposes.\"  \n\nState grants, the second-largest allocation at $4.8 billion, support outdoor recreation projects, while \"other purposes\" have received $2.7 billion for diverse programs not explicitly authorized by the LWCF Act. These include the Forest Legacy Program, endangered species conservation, deferred maintenance, and infrastructure projects. Some lawmakers and presidents have advocated for redirecting LWCF funds to broader priorities, though recent legislative proposals to formalize such shifts have not passed.  \n\nA notable peak in LWCF funding occurred under President Clinton’s Lands Legacy Initiative, which secured nearly $1 billion in one year—exceeding the annual authorization—for over a dozen conservation programs. Congress has discretion in approving presidential requests for LWCF funds, leading to allocations for programs like ecosystem restoration, historic preservation, and tribal land settlements.  \n\nCurrently, the largest portion of LWCF funding supports state formula grants, which require matching funds for conservation plans and projects. Competitive grants, without matching requirements, also receive LWCF support. Appendices A and B detail total appropriations for \"other purposes\" from FY1998 to FY2019, including annual allocations and program-specific funding.  \n\nIn summary, the LWCF remains a flexible funding mechanism for conservation and recreation, though its use for non-traditional purposes reflects evolving policy priorities. Congressional appropriations ultimately determine how LWCF revenues are distributed among federal, state, and other programs.  \n\n(Word count: 298)",

      "Acquisition management has been a long-standing challenge at NASA, although GAO has reported on improvements the agency has made in recent years. Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months. GAO is not making any recommendations in this statement, but has made recommendations in prior reports to strengthen NASA's acquisition management of its major projects. NASA has generally agreed with GAO's recommendations and taken steps to implement them."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel Report on NASA’s JWST and WFIRST Projects**  \n\nThe Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, commissioned by NASA in 2010, evaluated the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) projects, identifying critical challenges in cost estimation, resource allocation, and contractor oversight. The panel concluded that while JWST was technically sound, its baseline cost estimate lacked adequate reserves, rendering the project unexecutable without adjustments. Similarly, WFIRST faced funding shortfalls that would delay progress and inflate costs unless design complexity was reduced to stay within the $3.2 billion target.  \n\nKey findings include:  \n1. **Inadequate Reserves**: Independent reviews in 2006 and 2010 found JWST’s cost reserves insufficient (recommending 25–30% for complex projects), leading to schedule delays and budget overruns. The 2010 panel reaffirmed that unrealistic cost estimates jeopardized project execution.  \n2. **Management Shortcomings**: Poor planning, optimistic cost estimates, funding gaps, and weak contractor oversight were primary drivers of cost and schedule growth. NASA has since improved processes, including enhanced cost estimation, reserve allocation, and earned value management.  \n3. **Contractor Oversight**: JWST’s cost overruns were partly attributed to contractor misunderstandings of requirements, resulting in late design changes. NASA addressed this by increasing on-site presence, appointing a new project manager, and improving communication.  \n4. **WFIRST Challenges**: Forecasted funding gaps threatened to slow development, increasing long-term costs. NASA directed design simplifications to align with budget constraints.  \n\nThe report underscores the need for updated cost estimates, robust reserves, and proactive oversight to mitigate risks. NASA’s adoption of independent reviews (e.g., the WFIRST Independent External Review) reflects progress, but sustained vigilance is essential to ensure future projects remain executable.  \n\nPrepared by GAO staff, this analysis highlights lessons learned for Congress and NASA to improve large-scale mission planning and execution.  \n\n**End of Summary**",

      "The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days. For a general discussion of federal government shutdowns, see CRS Report RL34680, Shutdown of the Federal Government: Causes, Processes, and Effects, coordinated by Clinton T. Brass."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on Federal Funding Gaps and Continuing Resolutions**  \n\nFederal agencies typically rely on annual appropriations acts for funding. When these appropriations are delayed, a continuing resolution (CR) is often used to provide temporary budget authority. A funding gap occurs when neither a regular appropriations act nor a CR is in effect, potentially leading to a government shutdown. While funding gaps can happen at any time, they most commonly occur at the start of the fiscal year (October 1) or when a CR expires without immediate replacement.  \n\nIn 1980-81, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued legal opinions, later codified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, outlining restrictions on federal operations during funding gaps. Notably, a shutdown may be postponed if a new CR is expected the same day. Historically, some funding gaps have had minimal impact—such as a three-day gap in FY1984 that caused no disruption due to a holiday weekend—while others, like a one-day gap in 1984, led to partial furloughs.  \n\nSince the 1980s, there have been 20 funding gaps, seven beginning on October 1 and the rest occurring later in the fiscal year. Most were resolved quickly, but some, like the 16-day gap in FY1996, had significant consequences, including over 800,000 furloughed employees. More recently, FY2018 began with no enacted appropriations, forcing reliance on multiple CRs and a brief shutdown before a fourth CR was passed.  \n\nCongress has occasionally passed narrow CRs to fund specific programs during gaps, but no permanent solution has been enacted. The report emphasizes that while funding gaps and shutdowns are related, they are distinct events, with gaps only leading to shutdowns if unresolved. The legislative history demonstrates recurring challenges in timely appropriations, with varying impacts on government operations.  \n\n*(Word count: 250)*",

      "Full implementation of GPRAMA could facilitate efforts to reform the federal government and make it more effective. GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates. OMB staff agreed with these recommendations."

      "In February 2017, components of California's Oroville Dam failed, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 nearby residents. FERC is the federal regulator of the Oroville Dam and over 2,500 other dams associated with nonfederal hydropower projects nationwide. FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams. FERC agreed with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on FERC’s Dam Safety Practices**  \n\nThis report evaluates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) processes for ensuring dam safety, focusing on information collection, analysis of engineering studies, and relicensing reviews. The investigation was prompted by incidents like the Oroville Dam failure, where missing design documents and incomplete records raised concerns about oversight.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Information Collection and Analysis:**  \n   - FERC relies on inspections and engineering studies to assess dam safety but faces challenges with incomplete or missing documentation, as seen in the Oroville Dam case.  \n   - The agency uses a multi-tiered review process, including internal memos and approvals by Branch Chiefs and Regional Engineers, to validate studies like hydrology reports. Independent verification of inputs (e.g., flood rates) improves accuracy.  \n\n2. **Evaluation of Engineering Studies:**  \n   - FERC staff review dam performance studies, but inconsistencies in documentation and oversight gaps were noted.  \n   - Engaging subject-matter experts has reduced review times and enhanced study accuracy.  \n\n3. **Relicensing and Compliance:**  \n   - During relicensing, FERC assesses safety data but could strengthen transparency and accountability. Additional review layers may mitigate risks of regulatory capture.  \n\n### **Recommendations and Response:**  \n- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends improving documentation practices and reinforcing review protocols.  \n- FERC agreed with the findings and plans to implement GAO’s recommendations, including steps to address missing records and enhance study validation.  \n\n### **Methodology:**  \nThe review included analysis of FERC policies, forensic reports (e.g., Oroville Dam), and interviews with officials. A dual-analyst system ensured consistency in evaluating dam safety documents.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nWhile FERC’s processes include robust checks, gaps in documentation and oversight persist. Strengthening review mechanisms and ensuring complete record-keeping are critical to preventing future failures.

      "Federal agencies use heavy equipment such as cranes and forklifts to carry out their missions, but there is no government-wide data on federal agencies' acquisition or management of this equipment. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of heavy equipment. This report, among other objectives, examines: (1) the number, type, and costs of heavy equipment items that are owned by 20 federal agencies and (2) the heavy equipment that selected agencies recently acquired as well as how they decided whether to purchase or lease this equipment. GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively. The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Departments of the Interior and Defense concurred with these recommendations."

      "The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)**  \n\nThis report examines the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in encouraging banks to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. It outlines the CRA examination process, challenges in measuring the CRA’s impact, and recent policy discussions on modernization.  \n\n### **CRA Examination Process**  \nBanks are evaluated under a four-tiered rating system: *Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve,* or *Substantial Noncompliance*. Most banks receive *Satisfactory* or higher ratings, raising concerns about weak enforcement. Examinations assess banks based on three tests:  \n1. **Lending Test** – Evaluates mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer loan distribution.  \n2. **Investment Test** – Measures community development investments.  \n3. **Service Test** – Reviews retail services like branch accessibility and low-cost checking.  \n\nSmall banks are typically assessed only on lending, while large banks face all three tests. Points from these tests determine a composite rating, with *Outstanding* requiring strong performance in investment and service tests for large banks.  \n\n### **Challenges in Assessing CRA Impact**  \nThe CRA does not set specific lending quotas, making it difficult to attribute lending decisions directly to CRA incentives. Additionally, nontraditional loan products (e.g., interest-only mortgages) pose risks, though CRA-covered banks originated only 6% of high-cost loans to lower-income borrowers in 2006.  \n\n### **Modernization and Policy Recommendations**  \nRecent discussions highlight the need for CRA reform, including:  \n- **Timelier Examinations** – Reducing delays in evaluation releases to allow banks more time to adjust.  \n- **Performance Incentives** – Rewarding efficient lending, such as granting annual credits for long-term investments.  \n- **Consistency in Exams** – Industry stakeholders call for standardized examination processes to improve compliance.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile the CRA has influenced bank lending to LMI communities, its effectiveness remains debated due to high pass rates and lack of clear benchmarks. Modernization efforts aim to enhance transparency, efficiency, and impact, ensuring the CRA better meets its original goals.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "The misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, has contributed to increases in overdose deaths. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, in 2015 over 52,000 people died of drug overdose deaths, and about 63 percent of them involved an opioid. For those who are addicted to or misuse opioids, MAT has been shown to be an effective treatment. GAO was asked to review HHS and other efforts related to MAT for opioid use disorders. This report (1) describes HHS's key efforts to expand access to MAT, (2) examines HHS's evaluation, if any, of its efforts to expand access to MAT, and (3) describes efforts by selected stakeholders (states, private health insurers, and national associations) to expand access to MAT. GAO gathered information from HHS officials as well as a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders selected based on their MAT expansion activities, among other factors. GAO also assessed HHS's evaluation plans using internal control standards for defining objectives and evaluating results. In an effort to reduce the prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a goal to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders—four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation. While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability. In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible. In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts: States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location. Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications. National associations. Officials told GAO that they are conducting outreach and training for their members and developing tools and resource guides. For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers. GAO recommends that HHS take two actions: (1) establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT, and (2) establish timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts to expand access to MAT. HHS concurred with both recommendations."

      "Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to \"declare\" a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). In the interest of saving time, the authority to make the declaration has been delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Regional Administrators. Once issued, the FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal fire suppression assistance such as the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on certain public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster. This federal assistance requires a cost-sharing component such that state, local, and tribal governments are responsible for 25% of the expenses.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Congressional Research Service Report on Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs)**  \n\nThe report addresses frequently asked questions about Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs), which provide federal aid to state, local, and tribal governments for wildfire control and mitigation. FMAGs cover equipment, personnel, and grants but require a 25% non-federal cost share.  \n\n**Request Process:**  \nFMAG requests can be submitted to FEMA’s Regional Administrator at any time, including verbally for urgency, but must be followed within 14 days by written confirmation, including FEMA Forms 078-0-1 and 078-0-2. If denied, states may appeal within 30 days, providing additional justification. FEMA must respond to appeals within 90 days, and extensions may be requested under extenuating circumstances.  \n\n**Evaluation and Funding:**  \nFMAG eligibility is assessed based on threat severity, not the balance of FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which finances FMAGs. The DRF carries over unused funds yearly. FMAGs reimburse 75% of eligible expenses, with states required to submit grant applications within 90 days of approval. FEMA then has 45 days to approve or deny applications.  \n\n**Coordination with Other Assistance:**  \nFMAGs can coexist with other federal wildfire programs (e.g., Forest Service post-fire recovery aid) but generally not with emergency suppression aid unless under cooperative agreements (\"fire compacts\"). These agreements outline cost-sharing between federal and non-federal entities, particularly for mixed-land jurisdictions.  \n\n**Key Clarifications:**  \n- FMAG declarations do not preclude separate emergency or major disaster declarations, which require additional state requests.  \n- FMAGs aim to prevent the need for broader disaster declarations by enabling early, targeted support.  \n\nThe report underscores FMAGs’ role in rapid wildfire response while detailing procedural requirements, funding mechanisms, and interagency coordination.  \n\n*(Word count: ~300; fits one page at standard formatting.)*",

      "GAO has designated DHS management as high risk because of challenges in building a cohesive department. PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures. DHS did not concur with a recommendation to apply the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to identify and communicate workforce needs. GAO believes this recommendation is valid as discussed in the report."

      "DOD requested about $60 billion for fiscal years 2009 - 2017 to purchase goods and services overseas and reimburse service-members for costs incurred while stationed abroad. DOD uses foreign currency exchange rates to budget and pay (that is, disburse amounts) for these expenses. It also manages the FCFD account to mitigate a loss in buying power that results from foreign currency rate changes. GAO was asked to examine DOD's processes to budget for and manage foreign currency fluctuations. This report (1) describes DOD's revision of its foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised rates and projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to disburse funds to liquidate O&M obligations, and determined whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account balance. GAO analyzed data on foreign currency rates, DOD financial management regulations, a non-generalizable sample of foreign currency disbursement data, and FCFD account balances. The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency exchange rates (“budget rates”) during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for each of the nine foreign currencies it uses to develop its Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) budget request. These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions. DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure). GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."

The review found systemic issues in tracking gains and losses, incomplete data, and inconsistencies in fund transfers.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Losses and Unobligated Balances:** All military services reported losses in at least five fiscal years. DOD maintains the FCFD account balance to retain unobligated funds, often replenishing it to the statutory limit without fully analyzing projected losses.  \n2. **Data Limitations:** Missing obligation data in end-of-year reports hinders accurate tracking of gains and losses. Incomplete or erroneous data in Foreign Currency Fluctuation reports undermines decision-making.  \n3. **Fund Transfers:** While DOD uses loss projections to justify transfers *out* of the FCFD account, it does not apply the same analysis when transferring unobligated balances *into* the account.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. **Analyze Losses:** The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) should assess realized and projected losses to determine the appropriate FCFD account size and guide fund transfers.  \n2. **Improve Data Accuracy:** Revise Financial Management Regulations to enforce complete, accurate reporting, including assigning responsibility for correcting errors.  \n3. **System Updates:** The Secretary of the Army should develop a plan to update the General Fund Enterprise Business System to align with DOD financial reporting standards.  \n\n**DOD Response:**  \nDOD concurred with Recommendations 1, 3, and 4 but only partially agreed with Recommendation 2, citing existing processes for loss analysis. Technical corrections were incorporated into the final report.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe FCFD account provides flexibility to manage currency volatility, but better oversight, data integrity, and analytical rigor are needed to optimize its use.

      "Regulation of the banking industry has undergone substantial changes over the past decade. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following: Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate. Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question. Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue. Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline. What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Banking Regulatory Landscape Report**  \n\nThe past decade has seen significant transformation in the banking sector, driven by government interventions during the financial crisis, regulatory reforms, and evolving market conditions. The crisis exposed systemic risks and regulatory weaknesses, prompting reforms under the **Dodd-Frank Act**, which were implemented gradually alongside shifting economic trends. Key developments include the rise of **fintech** and the transition from historically low interest rates to a higher-rate environment.  \n\nThis report highlights several critical banking issues:  \n\n1. **Regulatory Reforms and Compliance**: Post-crisis regulations aimed to enhance financial stability, but concerns persist about their complexity, particularly for **community banks**. Section 201 of the **EGRRCP Act** seeks to simplify risk-weighted capital rules for smaller banks, which face disproportionate compliance burdens despite minimal involvement in high-risk activities. Recent proposals also aim to tailor the **Volcker Rule** to reduce uncertainty and adjust requirements based on bank size.  \n\n2. **Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) Policies**: Banks must file reports (e.g., **Suspicious Activity Reports** and **Currency Transaction Reports**) to flag potential criminal activity. Critics argue these requirements are inefficient and costly, prompting debates over adjusting thresholds or indexing them to inflation. Leaks like the **Panama Papers** and international pressure have intensified calls for transparency reforms.  \n\n3. **Consumer Protection**: The **CFPB** plays a central role in overseeing consumer financial products, though its authority remains a topic of debate.  \n\n4. **Large Banks**: Reforms under **P.L. 115-174** eased some prudential regulations for larger institutions, while proposed changes to capital requirements could further reduce their reserve obligations.  \n\n5. **Economic Conditions**: The Federal Reserve’s prolonged low-interest-rate policy, designed to stimulate growth, has begun normalizing, though anticipated disruptions (e.g., credit contraction) have not yet materialized.  \n\nThe report underscores ongoing congressional and regulatory focus on balancing financial stability with regulatory efficiency, particularly for community banks, while adapting to technological and economic shifts.

      "The effects of climate change, combined with other factors, may alter human migration trends across the globe, according to the International Organization for Migration. For example, climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, causing populations to move from an area. Climate change can also intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, or sea level rise, potentially altering longer-term migration trends. GAO was asked to review how U.S. agencies address climate change as a potential driver of global migration. For State, USAID, and DOD, this report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the agencies discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes agency activities on the issue. GAO analyzed documents on administration priorities; reviewed agency plans, risk assessments, and documentation of agency activities; and interviewed agency officials. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, a variety of executive branch actions related to climate change—such as executive orders and strategies—affected the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), including their activities that could potentially address the nexus of climate change and migration. For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum—rescinded in 2017—required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order—also rescinded in 2017—requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern. State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration. The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration. For example, USAID officials said that the agency's adaptation efforts, such as its Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion project in Ethiopia, were the most likely to include activities, such as enhancing resilience, that can indirectly address the issue of climate change as a driver of migration. GAO recommends that State provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for climate change risk assessments for country strategies. In commenting on a draft of this report, State indicated that it would update its integrated country strategy guidance and will specifically note that missions have the option to provide additional information on climate resilience and related topics."

Key findings highlight inconsistencies in prioritization and funding across administrations, as well as gaps in integrating climate risks into foreign assistance strategies.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Limited Focus on Climate-Driven Migration:**  \n   - Climate change is rarely cited as a primary factor in migration across reviewed policies. Only one regional bureau (East Asia and the Pacific) explicitly identified it as a challenge.  \n   - State’s 2014 adaptation plan briefly acknowledged climate change as a potential migration driver but provided minimal actionable guidance.  \n\n2. **Shifting Priorities and Funding Cuts:**  \n   - The previous administration issued executive orders on climate change, but the 2018 budget request eliminated funding for the Global Climate Change Initiative.  \n   - Adaptation plans required agencies to address climate resilience, but implementation varied.  \n\n3. **Inconsistent Risk Assessments:**  \n   - While some missions documented climate risks in country strategies (e.g., U.S. Southern Command’s disaster preparedness in Haiti), most lacked thorough assessments.  \n   - Only 1 of 10 reviewed country strategies from high-risk regions (Africa, East Asia, and the Pacific) included climate migration risks.  \n\n4. **Recommendation for Improvement:**  \n   - **State should formalize guidance** for climate risk assessments in integrated country strategies. State agreed to update its guidance by June 2019, allowing missions to include climate resilience annexes.  \n\n### **Agency Responses:**  \n- **State** supported the recommendation and committed to revising its strategy guidance.  \n- **USAID** and **DOD** provided technical feedback but did not oppose the findings.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe report underscores the need for consistent climate migration analysis in U.S. foreign assistance planning. While some progress is noted, stronger policy alignment and dedicated funding are necessary to address climate-related security and humanitarian risks.  \n\n**Report Access:** Available on the GAO website at [www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "The Forest Service, an agency within USDA, performs a variety of tasks as steward of 193 million acres of public forests and grasslands. Its budget execution process for carrying out its mission includes (1) allotments, which are authorizations by an agency to incur obligations within a specified amount, and (2) unliquidated obligations, which represent budgetary resources that have been committed but not yet paid. Deobligation refers to an agency's cancellation or downward adjustments of previously incurred obligations, which may result in funds that may be available for reobligation. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's internal controls over its budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) review and certification of unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report findings."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Forest Service Budget Authority and Control Processes Report**  \n\nThis report evaluates the U.S. Forest Service’s processes for budget authority, administrative control of funds, and fire incident financial management. The review identified several gaps in documentation, oversight, and timeliness that hinder effective financial controls.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Incomplete Guidance for Fund Transfers**: The Forest Service’s *Basic Budget Desk Guide* outlines steps for reviewing FLAME wildfire forecasts and strategizing fund transfers but lacks critical details. It does not specify factors for decision-making, require documentation of rationale, or assess risks to programs losing funds. Additionally, there is no formal review process by responsible officials before submitting transfer requests to the Chief.  \n\n2. **Delayed Cost Settlements**: The Forest Service lacks defined timelines for completing Cost Settlement Packages after wildfires. Reviews of four incidents revealed delays ranging from 9 months to 2 years post-fire, despite fires being contained within weeks. The absence of a policy to document fire closure dates further complicates accountability.  \n\n3. **Weak Internal Controls**: Handbooks lack detailed procedures for reviewing unliquidated obligations (e.g., verifying service delivery or accounting corrections). References to control objectives exist, but actionable steps and documentation requirements are missing.  \n\n4. **Non-Compliance with USDA Requirements**: The Forest Service has not fully documented or implemented a comprehensive system for fund control, as mandated by the USDA Budget Manual.  \n\n### Recommendations:  \nThe report urges the Chief of the Forest Service to:  \n- Design and document a robust fund control system, subject to USDA review (Recommendation 2).  \n- Establish clear processes for fire incident agreements to ensure timely reporting (Recommendation 4).  \n- Update manuals for allotments and obligations every 5 years, per agency policy (Recommendation 9).  \n\n### Agency Response:  \nThe Forest Service generally agreed with the findings and noted progress in addressing them.  \n\nThis report underscores the need for stronger financial governance to improve transparency, efficiency, and compliance.

      "Lead paint in housing is the most common source of lead exposure for U.S. children. HUD awards grants to state and local governments to reduce lead paint hazards in housing and oversees compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs. The 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Joint Explanatory Statement, includes a provision that GAO review HUD’s efforts to address lead paint hazards. This report examines HUD’s efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs, (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs, (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for its lead grant and rental assistance programs, and (4) measure and report on the performance of its lead efforts. GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to its grant programs, compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting. GAO also interviewed HUD staff and some grantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) lead grant and rental assistance programs have taken steps to address lead paint hazards, but opportunities exist for improvement. For example, in 2016, HUD began using new tools to monitor how public housing agencies comply with lead paint regulations. However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas: Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD’s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD’s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources. Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD’s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies’ self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD’s oversight of public housing agencies. Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs. Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts. In addition, it has not complied with annual statutory reporting requirements, last reporting as required on its lead efforts in 1997. Without better performance assessment and reporting, HUD cannot fully assess the effectiveness of its lead efforts. GAO makes nine recommendations to HUD including to improve lead grant program and compliance monitoring processes, request authority to amend its lead inspection standard in the voucher program, and take additional steps to report on progress. HUD generally agreed with eight of the recommendations. HUD disagreed that it should request authority to use a specific, stricter inspection standard. GAO revised this recommendation to allow HUD greater flexibility to amend its current inspection standard as indicated by analysis of the benefits and costs."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Agency Report on Lead Hazard Management and Compliance**  \n\nThis report evaluates the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) efforts to address lead paint hazards in housing, focusing on documentation, compliance, and reporting processes. While HUD’s Lead Office provides high-level guidance—such as the *Application Review Guide* for grant applications—it lacks detailed instructions for staff, particularly in scoring applications and escalating noncompliance cases. Key gaps include unclear criteria for point allocation in grant reviews and no formal process to evaluate the relevance of scoring factors.  \n\nThe report also highlights deficiencies in HUD’s adherence to *Title X* reporting requirements, which mandate annual/biennial updates on lead-safe housing initiatives. Although HUD has relied on annual performance reports since 1998, these omit legally required details, such as outcomes from voucher and public housing programs. Notably, HUD has not published a dedicated lead program report since 1997.  \n\nIn response to findings, HUD agreed with eight of nine recommendations, including a commitment to resume submitting reports to Congress and posting them publicly. However, it disputed one recommendation, emphasizing the need for further study on the impacts of lead risk assessment methods (e.g., visual vs. risk assessments) on housing availability.  \n\nThe report underscores the importance of robust documentation to retain institutional knowledge and ensure transparency. It calls for clearer staff guidance, improved compliance tracking, and timely reporting to Congress and the public.  \n\n**Agency Response and Dissemination**:  \nHUD, the EPA, and CDC reviewed the draft. While EPA offered no comments, HUD requested contextual additions about its lead grant programs and interagency roles. The final report was shared with congressional committees, HUD leadership, and other stakeholders, and is publicly accessible via the GAO website.  \n\n**Key Contributors**:  \nThe GAO team included John Fisher, Beth Faraguna, and others (listed in Appendix IV). Their work involved reviewing HUD documents, interviewing staff, and analyzing external evaluations to assess the efficacy of HUD’s lead hazard mitigation efforts.  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe report identifies systemic gaps in HUD’s lead safety protocols but notes willingness to address most issues. Strengthening documentation, evaluation, and reporting processes will be critical to safeguarding vulnerable households from lead exposure.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "In addition to more than 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, DOD employs about 760,000 federal civilians and more than 560,000 contractors. In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel. GAO believes the assessment is correct as discussed in the report."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the DOD Cost-Comparison Report Assessment**  \n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) submitted a Cost-Comparison Report evaluating the fully-burdened costs of federal civilian personnel versus service contractors at selected installations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed this report and found that DOD addressed three mandated elements and partially addressed a fourth.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Common Tasks Requirement**: DOD stipulated that personnel must perform at least 80% common tasks for a valid cost comparison.  \n2. **Contract Cost Components**: The report acknowledged that contractor costs include direct expenses (labor, non-labor) and indirect costs (overhead, profit). DOD used non-excludable contract costs in two methodologies to assess hiring authorities’ effectiveness.  \n3. **Incomplete Cost Accounting**: While DOD identified labor costs, it did not fully account for all mandated fully-burdened costs (e.g., training, benefits, facility overhead), partially addressing the reporting requirement.  \n4. **Challenges in Data Collection**: DOD faced difficulties in defining contractor roles, mirroring past GAO findings on contracted services inventories.  \n\n### **DOD’s Conclusions and Recommendations**:  \n- The report concluded that flexible hiring authorities needed refinement.  \n- It recommended that DOD and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) streamline or eliminate inefficient hiring practices.  \n\n### **GAO’s Assessment**:  \n- GAO disagreed with DOD’s assertion that it fully complied with reporting mandates, emphasizing that omitted language did not alter the requirement to include all fully-burdened costs.  \n- GAO maintained that DOD’s report fell short by excluding key cost components, as directed by Congress.  \n\n### **Congressional Directives**:  \nThe report was mandated to compare civilian and contractor costs, assess flexible hiring authorities, and propose statutory changes. GAO will submit its own evaluation to Congress within 120 days of receiving DOD’s report.  \n\n### **Distribution**:  \nCopies were sent to relevant congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. The full report is publicly available on GAO’s website.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While DOD’s report provided useful insights, it did not fully meet congressional requirements for comprehensive cost comparisons. GAO urges DOD to improve transparency in future assessments.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so. Its systems support a range of activities, such as processing Disability Insurance payments, to calculating and withholding Medicare premiums, and issuing Social Security numbers and cards. For fiscal year 2018, the agency planned to spend approximately $1.6 billion on IT. GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the agency plans to implement the recommendation by the end of this month. GAO has made 15 recommendations to SSA to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations from 2011 through 2018, and 1 recommendation to improve its CIO policies. While SSA has implemented nearly all of them, it would be better positioned to overcome longstanding IT management challenges when it addresses the CIO's role in its policies."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Agency Report on IT Management Weaknesses and Improvements**  \n\nThis report highlights ongoing concerns and progress related to the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) IT management practices, governance, and infrastructure. Over the years, audits have identified weaknesses in system development, strategic planning, requirements management, and the role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO). While SSA has taken steps to address many issues, challenges persist in software quality, system performance, and IT governance.  \n\n### **Key Findings and Recommendations**  \n1. **IT Infrastructure and Data Center Consolidation**:  \n   - SSA’s aging IT infrastructure has been deemed unsustainable, with rising maintenance costs.  \n   - Initially, SSA failed to meet federal data center optimization targets and lacked a complete consolidation plan. However, by 2018, the agency implemented all four GAO recommendations, closing 25% of tiered data centers.  \n\n2. **Incremental Development and CIO Oversight**:  \n   - SSA did not consistently involve its acquisition office in IT procurement reviews, as required.  \n   - While the CIO review process was partially compliant, not all IT acquisitions received proper oversight, limiting visibility into expenditures. Three recommendations were made to strengthen compliance.  \n\n3. **Software License Management**:  \n   - SSA’s policies only partially aligned with best practices, leading to inefficiencies. Six recommendations were issued to improve software license tracking and cost management.  \n\n4. **CIO Authority and IT Budgeting**:  \n   - SSA’s policies did not fully define the CIO’s role in key areas such as IT budgeting and security oversight. A 2018 recommendation urged SSA to align policies with federal laws, which the agency agreed to implement by September 2018.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nSSA has made progress in addressing IT management weaknesses, particularly in data center consolidation and incremental development. However, gaps remain in CIO governance, software licensing, and procurement oversight. Continued attention to these areas is critical to ensuring efficient, secure, and cost-effective IT operations.  \n\nFor further details, contact GAO’s Offices of Congressional Relations or Public Affairs.

      "To reform the federal government and make it more efficient and effective, agencies need to use data about program performance. The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges. OMB had no comments on this report."

      "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\"). The agency is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC also requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program."

In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress. GAO believes these recommendations remain valid, as discussed in the report."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Government Agency Report on NASA’s Commercial Crew Program Certification**  \n\nThis report evaluates NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP), which aims to certify contractor systems for transporting crew to and from the International Space Station (ISS). The review focuses on contractor progress, schedule risks, safety oversight, and contingency planning.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Certification Process and Schedule Delays**:  \n   - The CCP follows an incremental certification plan, requiring contractors (Boeing and SpaceX) to meet deliverables before the final agency certification review.  \n   - Schedule risk analyses, updated monthly, show delays in key milestones (e.g., uncrewed/crewed flight tests, design certification reviews). Figure 3 compares original and proposed schedules, highlighting ongoing adjustments.  \n   - As of 2018, Boeing had completed 19% of Phase 3 reports, but significant work remains, including hazard report closures.  \n\n2. **Safety Oversight**:  \n   - The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) noted concerns about the volume of unresolved safety documentation but acknowledged the program’s approach could be viable with proper controls.  \n   - Safety officials must approve a subset of requirements, though the program manager asserts all requirements contribute to system safety.  \n\n3. **Organizational and Cultural Factors**:  \n   - A \"dual-hatted\" safety technical authority maintains independence by operating outside the CCP chain of command.  \n   - The report references the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s findings, emphasizing the need for strong safety culture in human spaceflight programs.  \n\n### **Recommendations:**  \nThe report makes five recommendations to NASA, including:  \n1. **Congressional Reporting**: Include schedule risk analysis results in quarterly reports to Congress (Recommendation 1).  \n2. **Contingency Planning**: Develop a backup plan to ensure ISS crew presence if certification is delayed (Recommendation 5).  \n\nNASA concurred with three recommendations, partially concurred with one, and disagreed with one.  \n\n### **Methodology:**  \nThe analysis reviewed contractor and program documents (2017–2018), interviewed officials, and assessed schedule data from 2015–2018. Independent perspectives were gathered from ASAP and the Standing Review Board.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nWhile progress is being made, certification delays and safety documentation backlogs pose risks. Strengthened oversight and transparency, as well as contingency planning, are critical to ensuring safe and timely crew transport to the ISS.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "Concerns over efforts by U.S. taxpayers to use offshore accounts to hide income or evade taxes contributed to the passage of FATCA in 2010, which sought to create greater transparency and accountability over offshore assets held by U.S. taxpayers. House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad. State and Social Security Administration agreed with GAO's recommendations. Treasury and IRS neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Report on IRS Foreign Financial Asset Reporting**  \n\nThis report examines the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) enforcement of foreign financial asset reporting requirements, particularly under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). The findings highlight inefficiencies, overlaps, and unintended consequences of these reporting obligations for U.S. persons, especially those living abroad.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Overlap and Duplication:** Many taxpayers are required to file both Form 8938 (FATCA) and FBARs for the same foreign accounts, creating redundant reporting. Analysis suggests that a significant number of Form 8938 filings may be unnecessary.  \n2. **Data Inconsistencies:** IRS databases lack complete and consistent Form 8938 and related tax return data, hindering compliance enforcement. Table 6 highlights discrepancies across IRS systems.  \n3. **Unintended Consequences:** Stakeholders reported that Form 8938 requirements have led to employment and promotion denials for U.S. expatriates due to perceived compliance risks.  \n4. **FATCA vs. CRS Differences:** Appendix V details variations between FATCA and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), including reporting thresholds and due diligence requirements.  \n\n### **Recommendations:**  \n1. **Improve Data Accessibility:** The IRS Commissioner should ensure compliance units have consistent, complete access to Form 8938 and related tax return data (Recommendation 1).  \n2. **Leverage FATCA Data:** Develop a comprehensive plan to use FATCA data effectively for compliance efforts (Recommendation 2).  \n3. **Reduce Unnecessary Filings:** Assess and address factors leading to superfluous Form 8938 submissions (Recommendation 3).  \n\n### **Agency Responses:**  \nThe IRS, Treasury, State Department, and Social Security Administration (SSA) provided technical comments, which were incorporated. Treasury’s written response is included in Appendix VII, while State and SSA’s comments are in Appendices VIII and IX, respectively.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nStreamlining reporting requirements and improving data management could reduce taxpayer burden and enhance IRS efficiency. Implementing the recommendations would mitigate unnecessary filings and improve compliance oversight.  \n\nFor further details, the full report is available on the GAO website: [http://www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n---  \n*This summary condenses the report’s key points while omitting technical appendices and granular data tables for brevity.*",

      "Research has shown that students who experience discipline that removes them from the classroom are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school, and become involved in the juvenile justice system. Studies have shown this can result in decreased earning potential and added costs to society, such as incarceration and lost tax revenue. Education and Justice are responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the administration of discipline in public schools. GAO was asked to review the use of discipline in schools. To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate. Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure). Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex—such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students. Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues. For example, both agencies investigated cases alleging discrimination. Further, to help identify persistent disparities among the nation's schools, Education collects comprehensive data on school discipline every other year through its Civil Rights Data Collection effort."

      "Previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the United States have raised questions about the security of the U.S. government's process for adjudicating NIVs, which are issued to foreign nationals, such as tourists, business visitors, and students, seeking temporary admission into the United States. For example, the December 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the United States under a NIV. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks. Further, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants, such as email addresses and social media handles."

      "The SFSP, a federal nutrition assistance program, is intended to provide food to children in low-income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation. In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."

      "USPS is required to prefund its share of health benefits costs for its retirees. To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. USPS agreed that congressional action is needed and offered views on some policy approaches discussed in this report."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on USPS Financial Challenges and Retiree Health Benefits**  \n\nThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS) faces severe and worsening financial difficulties, driven primarily by the ongoing decline in First-Class Mail volume. The outlook for the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits (RHB) Fund is particularly concerning, as USPS lacks the resources to meet its funding obligations and is unlikely to make partial payments. This mirrors findings from a December 2012 report, which highlighted similar financial strains.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Declining Retiree Health Benefits in the Private Sector**: Survey data show that most companies no longer offer retiree health benefits, and those that do have implemented cost-saving measures, such as tightening eligibility or restructuring benefits. Some companies and state governments have integrated retiree health plans with Medicare, leveraging federal subsidies to reduce costs.  \n\n2. **Policy Approaches for Sustainability**: The report identifies eight potential policy approaches to address the RHB Fund’s financial instability, drawn from legislative proposals and private-sector practices. These include increasing postal retirees’ reliance on Medicare, adjusting funding schedules, and deferring payments (though this could shift costs to future ratepayers). No single approach is deemed sufficient on its own, and Congress must weigh trade-offs.  \n\n3. **Funding Challenges**: Unlike state governments, which typically do not prefund retiree health benefits, USPS is required to prefund its obligations. An alternative proposal suggests achieving 80% funding first, then moving toward 100% over time. However, market downturns could exacerbate funding shortfalls by simultaneously reducing USPS revenue and investment returns.  \n\n4. **Stakeholder Feedback**: The USPS concurred with the report’s conclusion that congressional action is necessary to ensure RHB Fund sustainability. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provided technical comments, while USPS offered additional insights on three policy approaches.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe report presents a broad, neutral overview of policy options without endorsing any specific solution. Congress must carefully evaluate the potential impacts of each approach, considering USPS’s financial constraints and the need for long-term stability. The report underscores the urgency of legislative action to address USPS’s unsustainable retiree health benefit obligations.  \n\nFor further details, the full report will be publicly available on the GAO website 30 days after its issuance.  \n\n---  \nThis summary distills the report’s key points while maintaining clarity and conciseness, as requested.

      "In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Report on Authorized Collectors of Unused Prescription Drugs**  \n\nThis report examines the processes and challenges associated with the collection of unused prescription drugs by authorized collectors, including pharmacies, narcotic treatment programs, and reverse distributors. Key findings highlight participation rates, cost barriers, and regulatory considerations.  \n\n### **Key Points:**  \n1. **Documentation Requirements:** Authorized collectors must maintain records of inner liner identification numbers, installation/removal dates, and transfers for destruction for at least two years.  \n2. **Participation Rates:** Only 1% of authorized collectors are narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, or distributors. Approximately 82% of collectors are located in urban areas (as of April 2017).  \n3. **Funding and Costs:**  \n   - Costs for purchasing, installing, and maintaining disposal bins deter participation. Estimates range from $500–$600 per location annually to thousands of dollars.  \n   - Over 25% of 2,233 authorized collectors using bins received external funding to offset costs. Some stakeholders subsidize pharmacies to encourage participation.  \n4. **Regulatory Challenges:**  \n   - The DEA allows flexibility in destruction methods but requires substances to be rendered non-retrievable.  \n   - Uncertainty around compliance (e.g., transportation of inner liners violating DOT regulations) discourages participation.  \n5. **Competing Programs:** Some stakeholders noted redundancy with local law enforcement drug take-back programs, reducing incentives for additional participation.  \n\n### **Agency Response:**  \nThe DEA agreed to notify stakeholders of updated guidance via website subscriptions starting August 2017. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which were incorporated into the report.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nWhile efforts to expand prescription drug disposal are underway, cost burdens, regulatory complexities, and competing initiatives limit broader participation. Continued funding and clearer guidance may improve engagement among authorized collectors.  \n\nFor further details, the full report is available on the GAO website: [http://www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n**Contact:**  \nDavid Draper, (202) 512-7114, draperd@gao.gov",

      "Gender-related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender. While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness. However, given the limited consumer concern, they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender-related price differences into their existing consumer education resources."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Agency Report on Gender-Based Disparities in Credit and Pricing**  \n\nThis report examines gender-based disparities in credit access, borrowing costs, and retail pricing across multiple sectors. The findings are based on a review of 21 studies meeting rigorous methodological standards, supplemented by consumer complaint analyses and price comparisons.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Credit Markets:**  \n   - Women, on average, pay higher interest rates than men for mortgages and small business loans, even after controlling for credit characteristics like credit scores and debt-to-income ratios.  \n   - While women generally had similar access to credit, newer female-owned businesses and women with limited managerial experience received significantly lower loan amounts than their male counterparts.  \n\n2. **Auto and Retail Pricing:**  \n   - Studies revealed gender-based price discrepancies in auto purchases and repairs, with women often quoted higher prices.  \n   - Analysis of online retail prices for personal care products showed higher average prices for women’s products compared to men’s, though the data was limited to advertised prices and not actual sales.  \n\n3. **Consumer Complaints:**  \n   - Complaints from databases managed by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicated instances where consumers perceived gender-based price discrimination.  \n\n**Methodology:**  \n- The report reviewed peer-reviewed studies, assessed using standardized social science criteria.  \n- Price comparisons were conducted for 16 personal care product pairs across four retailers, though results were not generalizable due to limitations in sales volume data.  \n- Complaints were analyzed through a probability-based sampling process to identify gender-related pricing concerns.  \n\n**Limitations:**  \n- Loan origination fees were excluded, potentially underestimating borrowing cost disparities.  \n- Retail price data reflected advertised, not actual, prices and did not account for sales volume.  \n\n**Agency Collaboration:**  \nThe draft report was shared with BCFP, DOJ, FTC, and HUD, with technical feedback incorporated. The final report will be restricted from public distribution for 30 days post-issuance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe findings suggest systemic gender disparities in financial and retail markets, warranting further investigation into underlying causes and policy interventions.  \n\n*Prepared by GAO staff, including key contributors listed in the appendix.*",

      "The combination of growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. The use of LNG as an engine (\"bunker\") fuel in shipping is also drawing attention from federal agencies and is beginning to emerge as an issue of interest in Congress. In 2008, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships requires vessels to either use fuels containing less than 0.5% sulfur or install exhaust-cleaning systems (\"scrubbers\") to limit a vessel's airborne emissions of sulfur oxides to an equivalent level. An option for vessel operators to meet the IMO 2020 standards is to install LNG-fueled engines, which emit only trace amounts of sulfur. Adopting LNG engines requires more investment than installing scrubbers, but LNG-fueled engines may offset their capital costs with operating cost advantages over conventional fuels. Savings would depend on the price spread between LNG and fuel oil. Recent trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long run than conventional fuels. LNG bunkering requires specialized infrastructure for supply, storage, and delivery to vessels. To date, the number of ports worldwide that have developed such infrastructure is limited, although growth in this area has accelerated. Early adoption of LNG bunkering is occurring in Europe where the European Union requires a core network of ports to provide LNG bunkering by 2030. LNG bunkering is also advancing in Asia, led by Singapore, the world's largest bunkering port. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, have about 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. LNG bunkering in the United States currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, and Port Fourchon, LA—with a third facility under development in Tacoma, WA. Bunkering of LNG-fueled cruise ships using barges also is planned for Port Canaveral, FL. The relative locations of other U.S. ports and operating LNG terminals suggest that LNG bunkering could be within reach of every port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. On the West Coast, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, are near the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma are adjacent to the proposed Tacoma LNG project. Since 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have taken steps to transition their fleets to use cleaner burning fuels, including LNG. Shippers of dry goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have taken delivery or have ordered LNG-fueled and LNG-capable vessels from U.S. shipyards in Philadelphia, PA, and Brownsville, TX. Another company operates five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels built in Gulfport, MS. Depending upon LNG conversions, the global LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030. If U.S. LNG producers were to supply a significant share of this market—on the strength of comparatively low LNG production costs—LNG bunkering could increase demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. Opportunities in LNG-related shipbuilding might be more limited, as most shipbuilding occurs overseas, although domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges could be one area of economic growth. Finally, engineering and construction firms could benefit from new opportunities to develop port infrastructure for LNG storage and transfer. However, while vessel conversion to LNG fuel may increase demand for U.S.-produced natural gas, it partially could be offset by reduced demand for U.S.-produced crude oil or refined products. Furthermore, while LNG can reduce direct emissions from vessels, fugitive emissions and environmental impacts from natural gas production and transportation could reduce overall emissions benefits. While the LNG industry has experienced few accidents, the Coast Guard has been developing new standards to address unique safety and security risks associated with LNG in vessel operations. The overarching consideration about LNG bunkering in the United States is uncertainty about how the global shipping fleet will adapt to the IMO sulfur standards over time. This uncertainty complicates decisions related to both private investment and public policy. Although Congress has limited ability to influence global shipping, it could influence the growth of LNG bunkering through the tax code and regulation, or through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole. Evaluating the potential implications of LNG bunkering within the context of broader energy and environmental policies may become an additional consideration for Congress. If LNG bunkering expands significantly, Congress also may examine the adequacy of existing measures to ensure the safety and security of LNG vessels, storage, and related facilities."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of LNG Bunkering Report**  \n\nThis report examines legislative, economic, environmental, and safety considerations surrounding the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel, particularly in the context of evolving international and U.S. regulations. Key issues include congressional oversight, infrastructure development, emissions standards, and market dynamics.  \n\n**Legislative and Regulatory Framework**  \nCongress has explored LNG bunkering through proposals like the *Waterway LNG Parity Act of 2017*, which sought to impose excise taxes on LNG used in inland waterways. The U.S. Coast Guard and EPA jointly enforce international emissions standards (MARPOL Annex VI), which mandate sulfur reductions in marine fuels by 2020. Compliance options for vessel operators include installing exhaust scrubbers (costing ~$4.2 million per ship) or switching to LNG, though scrubber installation capacity is limited to 300–500 ships annually.  \n\n**Market and Environmental Considerations**  \nLNG’s viability as a marine fuel depends on volatile price spreads between natural gas and fuel oil, though some price correlation persists. While LNG-powered ship orders are rising (e.g., 25% of cruise ships on order in 2017), environmental benefits remain uncertain. A 2015 study highlighted complexities in assessing LNG’s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, calling for further research.  \n\n**Infrastructure and Safety Challenges**  \nLNG bunkering infrastructure is developing, with projects like a $310 million European initiative, though regulatory and community concerns have caused delays. Safety risks—such as simultaneous bunkering and cargo operations—require stringent oversight. The Coast Guard has issued guidelines for risk assessments during LNG bunkering, building on security frameworks like the *Maritime Transportation Security Act* (MTSA), which addresses vulnerabilities in hazardous material transport.  \n\n**Global and Policy Uncertainty**  \nThe International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2020 sulfur standards apply uniformly, but their long-term impact on fleet adaptation is unclear. This uncertainty affects investment and policy decisions, compounded by the U.S. shale boom, which was unforeseen when MARPOL Annex VI was adopted.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nLNG bunkering presents opportunities for emissions reduction but faces legislative, economic, and technical hurdles. Policymakers must balance environmental goals, safety, and market realities while monitoring evolving global standards and infrastructure needs. Further research is needed to clarify LNG’s net environmental impact and inform regulatory approaches.  \n\n*(Word count: 300; fits one page at standard formatting.)*",

      "Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority. DOD concurred with the recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Report on Authorities Supporting Innovation in DOD Labs**  \n\nThis report examines four key authorities that enhance innovation within Department of Defense (DOD) laboratories by enabling flexible research initiatives and expedited hiring. While Congress has provided multiple authorities, this analysis focuses on those most critical for fostering scientific and technological advancement, particularly projects not bound by rigid budget cycles or predefined requirements.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Limited Utilization of Funding Authorities**: Only the Air Force Research Laboratory fully utilized the available 4% funding for flexible research projects. Other labs underused these funds, often due to competition with broader military construction needs. Navy labs, in particular, lagged in leveraging laboratory-initiated research authority for recapitalization and modernization.  \n\n2. **Hiring Challenges and Successes**: Direct hire authorities have proven effective in recruiting top talent, as evidenced by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center’s ability to hire over 160 researchers annually. However, obstacles persist in wider adoption across DOD labs.  \n\n3. **Infrastructure and Management Issues**: Aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance, highlighted by the Energy Inspector General and a 2015 commission report, remain significant challenges. DOD and partner agencies like NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) face ongoing risks in contract and project management capacity.  \n\n4. **Survey and Data Reliability**: The report’s findings are based on a comprehensive survey of all DOD labs, minimizing sampling error. Follow-up clarifications ensured data accuracy, and independent reviews validated analytical results.  \n\n### Recommendations and Response:  \nThe report includes three recommendations to DOD, which the department concurred with. DOE and NASA provided no comments on the draft. The findings were shared with relevant congressional committees, military secretaries, and agency leaders to inform policy improvements.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile DOD labs have tools to drive innovation, inconsistent usage of funding and hiring authorities, coupled with infrastructure deficits, hinder their full potential. Addressing these gaps is critical to maintaining technological superiority and operational readiness.  \n\nFor further details, the full report is available on the GAO website: [http://www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n---  \n*Prepared by: [Your Name/Team]*  \n*Date: [Insert Date]*  \n*Contact: GAO Congressional Relations/Public Affairs*",

      "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6), was signed into law on February 15, 2019. The act included a total of $647.0 million in funding for three trade-related agencies under the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) account—the International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). This represents a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA (a 0.4% increase from the FY2018 appropriation), $95.0 million in funding for USITC (a 1.4% increase), and a total of $68.0 million for USTR (a 0.2% decrease). The Administration's Request On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The FY2019 proposal included a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, an 8.9% decrease from FY2018 total appropriated amounts for these agencies. The Administration requested reducing funding for all three trade-related agencies. For FY2019, the request included $440.1 million in direct funding for ITA (an 8.7% decrease from the FY2018 appropriation), $87.6 million for USITC (a 6.5% decrease), and $63.0 million for USTR (a 13.2% decrease). Congressional Actions In the spring of 2018, the House and Senate reported FY2019 CJS appropriations bills, which included proposed funding for ITA, USITC, and USTR. The reported bills did not adopt many of the Administration's budget reductions, and instead proposed funding levels that were more similar to the FY2018-enacted amounts. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018. The House proposal recommended a total of $647.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This proposal was $56.8 million more (9.6%) than the Administration's request, and $0.7 million less (-0.1%) than the FY2018-enacted legislation. The House committee proposed $480.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95.0 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, comprised of $57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for trade enforcement activities as authorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125). The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3072 on June 14, 2018. The Senate committee-reported proposal recommended a total of $655.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This is $64.8 million (11.0%) more than the Administration's request and $7.3 million (1.1%) more than the FY2018-enacted appropriations. The Senate committee proposed $488.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95 million for USITC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, comprised of $57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for trade enforcement activities. After three continuing resolutions and a three-week lapse in funding, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act. 2019 (P.L. 116-6), which was signed into law on February 15, 2019. The act included a total of $647.0 million in funding for the three trade-related agencies, which represented a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 funding levels."

The President’s budget proposed funding reductions for these agencies, but Congress largely rejected these cuts, maintaining or increasing funding levels compared to the Administration’s requests.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Funding Rejections:** Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees declined the Administration’s proposed budget cuts. The final appropriations exceeded the President’s request by $42.5 million (15.4%) for ITA. Congress explicitly opposed closing domestic or overseas offices, including U.S. Export Assistance Centers, unless approved via reprogramming requests.  \n\n2. **ITA Priorities:** The Administration sought to shift ITA’s focus from export promotion to trade enforcement, proposing cuts to trade missions, the International Buyer Program, and certified trade fairs. However, Congress maintained funding for these activities, with the Senate emphasizing support for the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) at no less than FY2018 levels.  \n\n3. **USITC and USTR Funding:** USITC, which has bypass authority to submit its budget directly to Congress, received $95 million in both House and Senate proposals—aligning with historical support. USTR was allocated $72.6 million, reflecting bipartisan agreement.  \n\n4. **SelectUSA and SIAT:** The Senate tied SelectUSA’s $10 million funding to updated protocols discouraging investments by foreign state-owned entities. For ITA’s Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT), Congress rejected alternative funding proposals, directing ITA to fund it through its base budget.  \n\n5. **Trade Enforcement Trust Fund:** While not detailed in this summary, the report references this fund as a component of trade enforcement efforts.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Congress demonstrated strong support for trade agencies, overriding proposed cuts and office closures. The final budget emphasized export promotion, trade enforcement, and program continuity, reflecting legislative priorities diverging from the Administration’s austerity measures.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "In October 2017, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced that the projected life-cycle cost of the 2020 Census had climbed to $15.6 billion, a more than $3 billion (27 percent) increase over its 2015 estimate. A high-quality, reliable cost estimate is a key tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. Without this capability, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing program cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. GAO was asked to evaluate the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's revised life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census and the extent to which the Bureau is using it as a management tool, and compares the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence from Bureau officials responsible for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate and used its cost assessment guide ( GAO-09-3SP ) as criteria. Since 2015, the Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in improving its ability to develop a reliable cost estimate. While improvements have been made, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect all the characteristics of a reliable estimate. (See figure.) Specifically, for the characteristic of being well-documented, GAO found that some of the source data either did not support the information described in the cost estimate or was not in the files provided for two of its largest field operations. In GAO's assessment of the 2015 version of the 2020 Census cost estimate, GAO recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that each of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate is met. The Bureau agreed and has taken steps, but has not fully implemented this recommendation. A reliable cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, helping management make informed decisions. During this review, GAO found the Bureau used the cost estimate to inform decision making. Factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: Changes in assumptions. Among other changes, a decrease in the assumed rate for self-response from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5 percent in 2017 increased the cost of collecting responses from nonresponding housing units. Improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk. In general, contingency allocations designed to address the effects of potential risks increased overall from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017. An overall increase in information technology (IT) costs. IT cost increases, totaling $1.59 billion, represented almost 50 percent of the total cost increase from 2015 to 2017. GAO is not making any new recommendations but maintains its earlier recommendation—that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. In its response to this report, Commerce generally agreed with the findings related to cost estimation improvements, but disagreed that the cost estimate was not reliable. However, until GAO's recommendation is fully implemented the cost estimate cannot be considered reliable."

The GAO identified four key characteristics of a sound cost estimate: **comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible**. While the Bureau’s cost estimation process demonstrates some strengths, significant gaps remain, particularly in documentation and transparency.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Documentation Shortcomings**:  \n   - The Bureau’s cost estimates often lacked sufficient detail, with missing, inconsistent, or unclear documentation.  \n   - Source data for major operations (e.g., Address Canvassing and Non-Response Follow-Up) were either unsupported or unavailable.  \n   - Some cost calculations (e.g., mileage costs) could not be replicated due to insufficient descriptions.  \n\n2. **Progress and Challenges in Best Practices**:  \n   - The Bureau has improved in areas like **sensitivity analysis** and **risk contingency calculations**, addressing a 2016 GAO recommendation.  \n   - However, the Bureau still fails to fully document **assumption changes** and **data sources**, a recurring issue since 2016.  \n   - The Decennial Census Program’s cost estimate met **8 out of 12** best-practice steps but only **partially met** the remaining four.  \n\n3. **Management and Oversight**:  \n   - The Bureau updates estimates as milestones are met, but documentation remains inconsistent.  \n   - The **Secretary of Commerce** was urged to ensure the Bureau fully adopts high-quality estimating practices, particularly in **documentation**.  \n\n### **Conclusion and Next Steps**:  \nThe Bureau agreed with the report’s overall theme but did not explicitly endorse GAO’s recommendation to improve documentation. The next cost estimate update is expected in **Q1 of the coming fiscal year**, incorporating test results and revised assumptions.  \n\nThis report will be distributed to relevant congressional committees and agency officials **30 days after issuance**. Continued oversight is necessary to ensure the Bureau adheres to best practices for reliable cost estimation.  \n\n---  \n*Prepared by: [Your Name/Organization]*  \n*Date: [Insert Date]*",

      "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and Central Utah Project (CUP); the Department of Energy (DOE); the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); and several other independent agencies. DOE typically accounts for about 80% of the bill's funding. President Trump submitted his FY2020 detailed budget proposal to Congress on March 18, 2019 (after submitting a general budget overview on March 11). The budget requests for agencies included in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill total $38.02 billion—$6.64 billion (15%) below the FY2019 appropriation. The largest exception to the overall decrease proposed for energy and water programs is a $1.309 billion increase (12%) for DOE nuclear weapons activities. For FY2019, the conference agreement on H.R. 5895 (H.Rept. 115-929) provided total Energy and Water Development appropriations of $44.66 billion—3% above the FY2018 level, excluding supplemental funding, and 23% above the FY2019 request. It was signed by the President on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244). Emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $17.419 billion were provided to USACE and DOE for hurricane response by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), signed February 9, 2018. Major Energy and Water Development funding issues for FY2020 are listed below. They were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations. Water Agency Funding Reductions. The Trump Administration requested reductions of 31% for USACE and 29% for Reclamation for FY2020 from the FY2019 enacted levels. The largest reductions would be from USACE Operation and Maintenance (-48%) and Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account (-31%). Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Power Marketing Administration (PMA) Reforms. DOE's FY2020 budget request includes mandatory proposals to sell PMA electricity transmission lines and other assets, repeal certain PMA borrowing authority, and eliminate cost-based limits on the electricity rates charged by the PMAs. The proposals would need to be enacted in authorizing legislation. Termination of Energy Efficiency Grants. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would be terminated under the FY2020 budget request. The Administration had proposed to eliminate the grants in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress continued funding. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2020 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would be reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 83%, nuclear energy by 38%, and fossil energy by 24%. Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would provide new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's repository license application. Similar Administration funding requests for FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Elimination of Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E). The Trump Administration proposes no new appropriations for ARPA-E in FY2020 and to cancel $287 million in unobligated balances from previous appropriations. Similar proposals to terminate ARPA-E in FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Loan Programs Termination. The FY2020 budget request would terminate DOE's Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Administration proposals to eliminate the programs were not included in the enacted appropriations measures for FY2018 and FY2019. Weapons Activities. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than it was in FY2019 ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion), in contrast to a proposed 10% reduction in DOE's total funding. Notable proposed increases would be used for warhead life extension programs and preparations for increase production of plutonium pits (warhead cores)."

      "Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on the Declining Use of Cash and Rise of Electronic Payments**  \n\nThis report examines the declining use of cash in favor of electronic payment systems and explores the potential implications of this shift. It is divided into two main sections: an analysis of cash and noncash payment systems, and an assessment of the possible outcomes if cash becomes significantly displaced.  \n\n### **Part I: Cash vs. Noncash Payment Systems**  \nThe first section compares cash with electronic payment methods (e.g., debit/credit cards, digital wallets, and potential central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs). Cash remains widely used but has seen a decline, with Federal Reserve data suggesting a drop from 84.8 billion to 69.4 billion annual transactions, though methodological issues may mean the actual decline is smaller.  \n\nKey points include:  \n- **Advantages of cash**: Privacy, universal acceptance, and no reliance on digital infrastructure.  \n- **Disadvantages of cash**: Handling costs (e.g., counting, security) and susceptibility to tax evasion.  \n- **Electronic payment systems**: Faster and more convenient but may involve fees, exclusion of unbanked populations, and privacy concerns.  \n- **Obstacles to digital adoption**: High intermediary fees (e.g., debit card swipe fees, which prompted the Durbin Amendment), lack of access for low-income individuals, and technological barriers.  \n\n### **Part II: Implications of a Cashless Economy**  \nA reduced role for cash could bring benefits and risks:  \n- **Potential benefits**: Lower transaction costs for businesses, reduced tax evasion, and improved efficiency.  \n- **Risks and costs**:  \n  - **Financial exclusion**: Around 5% of U.S. households are unbanked, often due to high fees or low income.  \n  - **Privacy concerns**: Electronic payments leave digital trails, unlike anonymous cash transactions.  \n  - **System vulnerabilities**: Dependence on digital infrastructure raises cybersecurity and stability risks.  \n  - **Business impacts**: Some small businesses may struggle with payment processing fees.  \n\nThe report also discusses emerging alternatives, including private digital payment systems and hypothetical CBDCs, which could offer benefits like faster transactions but face adoption challenges.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile electronic payments are growing, the decline of cash presents complex trade-offs. Policymakers must balance efficiency gains against risks like exclusion, privacy loss, and market concentration in payment systems. The report suggests further analysis is needed to understand long-term effects, particularly on vulnerable populations.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Surety Bond Guarantee Program is designed to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracts, by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds for small businesses that cannot obtain surety bonds through regular commercial channels. The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The limit had been $2 million since 2000, with a temporary increase from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that such a guarantee was necessary. Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses. This report examines the program's origin and development, including (1) the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program that initially provided a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed surety bonds without the SBA's prior approval; (2) P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and (3) the decision to increase the program's bond limit."

Key points include:  \n\n1. **Program Funding and Fees**:  \n   - The program initially charged small businesses 0.2% of the contract price for bonds.  \n   - A $20 million transfer from the SBA’s Business Loan and Investment Revolving Fund was approved to bolster the program without increasing the federal deficit. Congress has not needed to appropriate additional funds due to sufficient reserves.  \n\n2. **Declining Participation**:  \n   - Participation by larger surety companies has decreased, attributed to administrative burdens, such as SBA’s pre-approval requirements for bonds, and higher costs for processing smaller bonds compared to larger ones.  \n\n3. **Proposed Reforms**:  \n   - A \"preferred surety\" designation was proposed to streamline approvals for qualified sureties while retaining SBA oversight.  \n   - The SBA considered merging its Prior Approval and Preferred Surety Bond (PSB) programs to simplify processes, though no formal opposition to this merger has been documented.  \n\n4. **Program Performance**:  \n   - The program has maintained a positive cash flow for 12 years, with $97 million in its Revolving Fund.  \n   - Fees for contractors are determined by the SBA and published in the *Federal Register*, rounded to the nearest dollar.  \n\n5. **Congressional and Industry Feedback**:  \n   - Stakeholders, including minority- and women-owned small businesses, emphasize reducing paperwork, lowering fees, and maintaining high guarantee rates.  \n   - Testimony and GAO reviews highlight the program’s importance for smaller firms but offer limited guidance on optimal program size or metrics for evaluation.  \n\n6. **Legislative Activity**:  \n   - Proposals to increase bond limits (e.g., to $5–$10 million) were not included in final legislation.  \n   - The SBA continues to evaluate program improvements, including adjusting guarantee rates and consolidation.  \n\nThe report underscores the program’s role in supporting small businesses while identifying administrative and structural challenges that hinder broader participation.

      "VA has pressing infrastructure needs. The Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorized VA to accept donated real property—such as buildings or facility construction or improvements—through a pilot program. VA has initiated one project in Omaha, Nebraska, through a partnership with a donor group. VA can accept up to five donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021. The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs. GAO is recommending that VA: (1) establish pilot program objectives, (2) develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan, and (3) document roles and responsibilities and identify available and needed staff resources. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations."

      "Federal agencies and the nation's critical infrastructures—such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services—are dependent on information technology systems to carry out operations. The security of these systems and the data they use is vital to public confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings in each of these action areas, including protecting cyber critical infrastructure, managing the cybersecurity workforce, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Although many recommendations have been addressed, about 1,000 have not yet been implemented. Until these shortcomings are addressed, federal agencies' information and systems will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies since 2010 aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings. As of August 2018, about 1,000 still needed to be implemented."

      "NSF has identified potential benefits and challenges associated with its use of rotators. Benefits include fresh perspectives and close connections to the scientific community, while challenges include staffing turnover and higher costs for some rotators compared with permanent employees. GAO was asked to review NSF's use and management of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs, among other things. This report examines (1) the number, costs, and uses of NSF rotators for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017; (2) the strategies NSF has used to manage rotator costs and the results of these efforts; and (3) the extent to which NSF has a workforce strategy for using rotators and has evaluated the results of its rotator programs. GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. The numbers of rotators—outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment—at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018. NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult. Without a workforce strategy and evaluation of results, NSF is limited in its ability to manage and, if warranted, adjust its use of rotators. GAO recommends that NSF develop an agency-wide strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with permanent staff and evaluate the contributions of its rotator programs toward NSF's human capital goals and programmatic results. NSF agreed with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Workforce Strategy Report**  \n\nThe report examines the NSF’s efforts to develop a strategic workforce framework to balance permanent federal employees and temporary rotators (such as Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) and Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program participants). Key findings and recommendations focus on optimizing workforce composition, assessing program effectiveness, and aligning human capital decisions with the agency’s scientific mission.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Workforce Strategy Development**:  \n   - In February 2017, an NSF steering committee recommended expanding the IPA program into a broader agency-wide workforce strategy. The goal was to ensure an optimal mix of federal and rotator staff to meet NSF’s needs.  \n   - A proposed process included job analyses to identify skills gaps, assess roles, and determine whether functions were better suited for permanent employees or rotators.  \n   - Strategies to address workforce imbalances included succession planning and adjusting the ratio of permanent staff to rotators.  \n\n2. **Lack of Program Evaluation**:  \n   - While NSF gathered feedback from rotators and supervisors in 2014, the agency did not fully assess how rotator programs contributed to scientific mission outcomes or human capital goals.  \n   - Reports in 2017 and 2018 did not commit to evaluating the impact of rotator programs on NSF’s objectives.  \n\n### **Recommendations:**  \n1. **Evaluate Rotator Program Contributions**:  \n   - The Director of Human Resource Management should assess how IPA and VSEE programs support NSF’s human capital goals and programmatic results.  \n2. **Implement Strategic Workforce Planning**:  \n   - NSF should conduct ongoing workforce analyses to optimize recruitment, retention, and role assignments between federal employees and rotators.  \n\n### **NSF’s Response**:  \nNSF agreed with the recommendations, stating that implementation would strengthen workforce planning and mission fulfillment. The agency also provided technical corrections, which were incorporated into the final report.  \n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nThe report underscores the need for NSF to adopt a data-driven workforce strategy, ensuring that rotator programs effectively support the agency’s scientific mission. By evaluating program outcomes and refining workforce balance, NSF can enhance its operational efficiency and strategic decision-making.  \n\n**Report Availability**:  \nThe full report is accessible on the GAO website at [http://www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."

The review highlights gaps in DOE’s 2016 long-term strategic assessment of the SPR, which failed to determine the optimal reserve size due to insufficient analysis of market fluctuations, private-sector roles, and cost-benefit considerations. The GAO notes that federal programs like the SPR were designed decades ago and may not align with current energy challenges.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Inadequate SPR Review Process:** DOE has not consistently reexamined the SPR’s size or relevance. In 2006 and 2014, GAO found that DOE lacked periodic reviews, despite recommending such evaluations. DOE’s 2016 review omitted critical factors like private-sector reserves (e.g., the U.K. model) and dynamic market projections.  \n2. **Outdated Policies:** Many federal energy policies were created for past market conditions and may not address today’s vulnerabilities, such as regional fuel supply disruptions.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \nThe GAO proposes four actions to improve SPR oversight:  \n1. **Supplement the 2016 Review:** Conduct additional analysis incorporating private-sector responses, oil market forecasts, and cost-benefit comparisons of varying SPR sizes (Recommendation 1).  \n2. **Periodic Reviews:** Mandate regular strategic reviews (e.g., every 5 years) for Congress, assessing market changes and SPR efficacy (Recommendation 2).  \n3. **Regional Reserves Study:** Evaluate the need for regional petroleum product reserves in areas prone to supply disruptions and report findings to Congress (Recommendation 3).  \n4. **Excess Assets Plan:** Study the impact of congressionally mandated SPR sales and develop options for managing excess capacity, seeking congressional approval if needed (Recommendation 4).  \n\n**DOE’s Response:**  \nDOE agreed to periodic reviews (Recommendation 2) and the excess assets study (Recommendation 4) but only partially supported Recommendation 1 and disagreed with Recommendation 3, citing resource constraints.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe GAO stresses the need for a modernized, data-driven approach to ensure the SPR’s effectiveness in a changing energy landscape. The report will be publicly available on the GAO website 30 days after issuance.  \n\n**Key Contributors:**  \nGAO staff, including Quindi Franco, Nkenge Gibson, and others, contributed to this analysis.

      "The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Report on Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs)**  \n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) to ensure their rates are sufficient to repay the U.S. Treasury for allocated hydropower costs. While most PMA operations are self-funded, the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) require congressional appropriations for capital expenses. Each PMA faces unique regional challenges, as outlined below.  \n\n**Bonneville Power Administration (BPA):**  \nBPA is exploring alternative financing methods—such as nonfederal debt refinancing and lease-purchases—as it nears its debt limit. It has also developed strategies to adapt to shifting power generation and demand while maintaining cost-based rates. BPA repays Treasury debt primarily through electricity sales. Notably, its ratepayers bear the debt service for Energy Northwest’s Regional Cooperation debt refinancing.  \n\n**Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA):**  \nSWPA faces overcapacity issues and relies on congressional authority to manage revenue fluctuations across high- and low-water years. It utilizes prior-year balances, alternative financing, and limited appropriations (6.5% of its budget) to ensure rate stability for customers.  \n\n**Western Area Power Administration (WAPA):**  \nWAPA’s *Strategic Roadmap 2024* guides its long-term operations, focusing on transmission development and market integration. It joined the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), yielding annual benefits exceeding $11.5 million. Two other WAPA regions may follow. In 2017, WAPA delivered 101% of its average hydroelectric power sales, achieving $40 million in annual customer savings.  \n\n**Cross-PMA Proposals:**  \nIn 2018, the Trump Administration proposed selling federal transmission assets to reduce taxpayer risk and improve efficiency, projecting $9.5 billion in savings over a decade. However, opposition stalled the plan, as Congress retains authority over PMA asset transfers. Similar proposals since the Reagan era have been blocked by legislative measures, including a 1986 law prohibiting executive branch actions without congressional approval.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPMAs operate under distinct financial and regional constraints but share challenges in balancing debt repayment, market demands, and infrastructure needs. While privatization efforts persist, Congress remains the decisive authority over PMA assets and operations.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years. On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan includes 304 ships, or an average of about 10 per year. If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. Another oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. Decisions that Congress makes regarding Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base."

Key topics include the prioritization of the Columbia-class submarine program, funding for the amphibious assault ship LHA-9, and broader strategic and budgetary factors influencing Navy procurement.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Columbia-Class Priority**: Since 2013, the Navy has designated the Columbia-class submarine program as its top priority, ensuring full funding even if it requires diverting resources from other shipbuilding programs.  \n2. **Fleet Expansion Plans**: The Navy is exploring strategies to increase its fleet size, including additional submarines, carriers, and destroyers, contingent on congressional budget approvals. Shipbuilders currently operate at 70-80% capacity, with potential for expansion.  \n3. **Industrial Base Challenges**: The submarine industrial base requires sustained investment, including multi-year contracts, supplier development funding, and government incentives to maintain workforce stability and infrastructure readiness.  \n4. **Congressional Actions**: Table 6 summarizes FY2020 congressional adjustments to Navy shipbuilding funding, reflecting modifications to requested amounts.  \n5. **Lessons Learned in Shipbuilding**:  \n   - Clearly define operational requirements early.  \n   - Balance cost, risk, and performance realistically.  \n   - Use appropriate contract structures to align incentives.  \n   - Avoid deferred maintenance and cost overruns.  \n\n### **Strategic and Budgetary Context (Appendix A):**  \nThe report highlights the importance of stable funding commitments, such as multi-year contracts and advance procurement, to support industrial base readiness. Delays or budget cuts risk workforce reductions and production inefficiencies.  \n\n### **Additional Considerations:**  \n- **Cost Management**: The report distinguishes between minimizing initial procurement costs (which may lead to future expenses) and avoiding long-term cost growth through disciplined planning.  \n- **Surface Ship Production**: Expanding support ship construction (e.g., ESBs) is deemed feasible, with shipyards capable of increased output.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe Navy’s shipbuilding plans face competing demands between strategic priorities, budget constraints, and industrial capacity. Congressional decisions on funding, contract structures, and industrial support will significantly impact the feasibility of fleet expansion and modernization efforts.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Agency Report on Physical Security Assessments**  \n\nThis report examines the alignment of selected federal agencies’ physical security assessment methodologies with the Interagency Security Committee’s (ISC) risk management standards and identifies management challenges in conducting and monitoring these assessments. The review focused on agencies including the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Outdated Security Policies**: CBP’s security checklist was based on its 2009 handbook, which predates the 2010 ISC Standard. Although CBP planned to update its handbook by September 2018, competing priorities—such as addressing assessment backlogs—delayed revisions. Without updated data collection and analysis requirements, CBP may struggle to monitor its physical security program’s performance effectively.  \n\n2. **Assessment Backlogs and Scheduling Issues**:  \n   - CBP developed a plan to eliminate its assessment backlog by fiscal year 2018, but the schedule appeared unrealistic (e.g., assuming one specialist could complete six assessments in three days).  \n   - ARS began assessments for two facilities in 2017, while the Forest Service missed a reassessment because facility staff did not request one.  \n\n3. **Inconsistent Reporting and Monitoring**:  \n   - USDA revised its assessment format to include risk calculations and trained specialists, but its draft manual lacked clear data reporting and monitoring requirements.  \n   - Many security recommendations remained unimplemented, though funding requests were submitted to address most open countermeasures.  \n\n### Recommendations:  \nThe report urges the Secretary of Agriculture to:  \n1. **Include data collection and analysis requirements** in USDA’s revised physical-security manual to improve program monitoring.  \n2. **Direct ARS and the Forest Service** to implement a long-term assessment schedule with milestones, ensuring higher-level facilities are reassessed at least every three years.  \n\n### Agency Responses:  \n- The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation (DOT), and Agriculture (USDA) agreed with the recommendations.  \n- DHS and USDA provided action plans and timelines for implementation, while DOT submitted technical comments.  \n\n### Audit Scope:  \nThe performance audit (June 2016–August 2017) reviewed agency methodologies, interviewed staff, and analyzed data reliability. Findings were deemed sufficient to support conclusions.  \n\nThis report highlights critical gaps in physical security protocols and underscores the need for updated policies, realistic timelines, and robust monitoring to mitigate risks effectively.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "This report provides an overview and analysis of FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The primary focus of this report is on congressional direction and funding provided to DHS through the appropriations process. It includes an Appendix with definitions of key budget terms used throughout the suite of Congressional Research Service reports on homeland security appropriations. It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018. The resolution, which covered DHS along with several other departments and agencies, continued funding at a rate of operations equal to FY2018 with some exceptions. This continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, after which point annual appropriations lapsed. A partial government shutdown ensued for 35 days until continuing appropriations were resumed January 25, 2019, by P.L. 116-5. P.L. 116-6, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, was passed by Congress on February 14, 2019, and signed into law the following day. Division A of the act included the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, which included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters, and $165 million in OCO funding for the Coast Guard. This report will be updated in the event of FY2019 supplemental appropriations actions."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on DHS Appropriations**  \n\nThis report serves as a resource for understanding Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations, providing contextual information, key budgetary concepts, and a list of Congressional Research Service (CRS) policy experts for further consultation. It does not offer in-depth analysis of specific issues like mandatory funding (e.g., retirement pay) or systematically track legislation authorizing or amending DHS programs.  \n\nThe report explains essential budgetary terms—such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments under the Budget Control Act (BCA)—in an appendix. For a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and the appropriations process, readers are directed to CRS Report R42388 and the Government Accountability Office’s budget glossary.  \n\nThe data presented in the report reflects budget authority, with calculations based on unrounded figures for precision, though narrative discussions round to the nearest million. The scoring methodology aligns with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) standards, and comparisons with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data are avoided due to technical discrepancies.  \n\nThe report outlines the FY2019 DHS appropriations process, from the Administration’s initial request through committee actions in the House and Senate, continuing resolutions, and eventual enactment. Key differences between House and Senate bills included disaster relief funding and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the Coast Guard. The Senate bill (S. 3109) proposed $38.68 billion in net discretionary funding, including $163 million in OCO funding for the Coast Guard, while the House bill excluded the OCO provision. Neither bill advanced to a floor vote.  \n\nThe appropriations structure follows the organization detailed in the explanatory statement accompanying the enacted bill (H.Rept.). Tables compare requested, committee-recommended, and enacted funding levels, with separate lines for components like the Management Directorate and Office of the Inspector General (OIG), which received funding from outside their primary title (Title I).  \n\nIn January 2019, the acting OMB director requested an additional $4.1 billion, which is excluded from the report’s calculations. The House Appropriations Committee’s markup added a net $13 million to the bill’s score, though this adjustment is not reflected in the report’s tables.  \n\nOverall, the report provides a high-level overview of DHS appropriations for FY2019, emphasizing the legislative process, key funding distinctions, and available resources for further research. It serves as a foundational guide for policymakers and stakeholders navigating DHS budgetary discussions.",

      "The United States is a member of the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, which promote democracy, health care, agricultural development, and scientific exchange. GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. GAO recommends that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. USDA and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Government Accountability Report on State-Funded Activities**  \n\nThis report evaluates the performance of U.S. government-funded activities administered by the State Department, USAID, HHS, and USDA in collaboration with inter-American organizations, including the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The review assesses progress against prior-year performance, alignment with U.S. priorities, and compliance with monitoring and budgetary oversight requirements.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Performance and Budget Review:**  \n   - The Annual Performance and Budget Review informs State’s budgetary decisions by tracking program achievements, expenditures, and outcomes. For example, the 2016 OAS Development Assistance Program trained foreign officials on U.S. small business policies.  \n   - USAID requires written approval for projects by Mission Directors, while financial and internal control audits are publicly reported (e.g., OAS Inspector General’s 2017 audit updates).  \n\n2. **Monitoring and Compliance Gaps:**  \n   - Two of four reviewed agreements fully documented monitoring provisions, but **Agreement 2 lacked 4 of 5 required provisions**, including time-bound performance goals.  \n   - **State lacked full documentation for 31% of monitoring activities** (5 of 16), though partial records existed for most. For example, standard reporting metrics were incomplete in one agreement.  \n   - HHS had partial documentation for one agreement’s semiannual progress reports but complied fully for others.  \n\n3. **Risk Management and Oversight:**  \n   - State’s Bureau of Administration conducts annual reviews to strengthen grant oversight and mitigate risks. A new system for overseas grants is slated for full deployment by FY2019.  \n   - U.S. agencies actively participate in budget subcommittees and audit panels for three of the four inter-American organizations.  \n\n### **Recommendations:**  \n1. **USDA** should ensure all agreements with inter-American organizations include key monitoring provisions per agency guidance.  \n2. **USAID** must improve documentation to support informed budgetary and programmatic decisions.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nWhile agencies demonstrate progress in tracking performance and financial controls, gaps in monitoring documentation risk undermining accountability. The report urges stricter adherence to oversight requirements to ensure effective use of taxpayer funds. The findings were shared with State, USAID, HHS, and USDA, with technical feedback incorporated. The report will be publicly released after 30 days unless disclosed earlier.  \n\n**GAO Contacts:**  \n- Congressional Relations: [Details on last page]  \n- Public Affairs: [Details on last page]  \n- Full report: [www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov)  \n\n**Key Contributors:** Pierre Toureille, Julia Jebo Grant, and team (Appendix V).  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "The VA is responsible for ensuring that veterans have reasonable access to burial options in a national or state veterans' cemetery. In fiscal year 2018 VA estimated that about 92 percent of veterans had reasonable access to burial options, which was an increase from 90 percent in fiscal year 2014 but short of its goal of 96 percent by the end of fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access. GAO recommends that NCA fully adopt cost-estimating leading practices into its procedures to assist in improving its cost estimates for establishing cemeteries. NCA concurred with our recommendation."

The review highlights inconsistencies and shortcomings in NCA’s adherence to best practices outlined in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (Cost Guide).  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Land Acquisition Timeline**: NCA began acquiring land for the Chicago site in June 2011, with completion projected for July 2018. However, inconsistencies in documentation raised concerns about the reliability of the information provided.  \n\n2. **Cost-Estimating Deficiencies**: NCA’s cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate the 12 critical steps from the GAO Cost Guide, which are essential for producing reliable estimates. An assessment revealed that NCA’s guidance:  \n   - Fully met only **one step** (obtaining data through market surveys and historical data).  \n   - Did not meet **one step** (conducting sensitivity analysis to evaluate changing assumptions).  \n   - Lacked any discussion of **risk management**, a key component of sound cost estimation.  \n\n3. **Guidance Documents**: NCA relies on multiple documents, including the VA Manual and Program Guide 18-15, which fail to align with GAO’s best practices. While VA agreed to update its guidance in response to prior recommendations, NCA’s cemetery-specific procedures remain noncompliant.  \n\n4. **Burial Access Planning**: NCA uses county-level population data to identify unserved veteran populations, but GAO’s analysis of census tract data suggests this method may not optimize burial site selection. VA disputed GAO’s conclusion, asserting significant progress in improving access.  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \nThe Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs to revise NCA’s cost-estimating procedures to fully integrate the 12 GAO Cost Guide steps, ensuring more accurate and reliable project estimates.  \n\n**VA Response**:  \nVA concurred with the recommendation but contested GAO’s characterization of NCA’s progress on burial access, citing \"significant\" advancements. Technical comments were incorporated into the final report.  \n\nThis report underscores the need for improved transparency and rigor in NCA’s planning and cost estimation to better serve veterans.

      "The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act. All of the agencies either concurred or generally concurred with GAO's recommendations."

The review identified inconsistencies in how contracts are recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), including misreported trade agreement applications and BAA exceptions.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Data Reporting Errors**: Contracting officials sometimes inaccurately reported whether contracts fell under trade agreements or BAA exceptions. For example, two of six contracts incorrectly claimed a trade agreement waiver.  \n2. **FPDS-NG Limitations**: The system only allows one country of origin per contract, complicating reporting for contracts with both domestic and foreign products. A recent FAR change requiring line-item reporting may improve transparency.  \n3. **Incomplete Documentation**: Contract files often lacked manufacturing or origin details, and some waivers were not properly recorded. Contracting officers relied on the System for Award Management (SAM) but did not consistently document verification.  \n4. **Training and Guidance Gaps**: Some agencies lacked clear tools or training to help contracting officers determine BAA applicability, document exceptions, and verify product origins.  \n\n### **Recommendations:**  \n- **HHS** should provide guidance and training to help contracting officials:  \n  - Determine TAA applicability and BAA waivers.  \n  - Document non-availability exceptions and secure approvals.  \n  - Verify product origins and address inconsistencies.  \n- **Agencies** should improve FPDS-NG data accuracy and ensure proper recording of BAA exceptions at the order level.  \n\n### **Agency Responses:**  \n- **HHS, DHS, and VA** agreed with recommendations and outlined corrective actions.  \n- **DOD** did not comment but was previously advised by its Inspector General to improve BAA compliance.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nWhile FPDS-NG and agency practices have improved, persistent reporting errors and system limitations hinder transparency. Enhanced training, documentation, and system updates are needed to ensure accurate tracking of BAA and TAA compliance.  \n\n**GAO Contact:** Candice Wright, Assistant Director; Jennifer Dougherty, Analyst-in-Charge.  \n**Report Scope:** Audit conducted from October 2017 to December 2018.  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits. Congress's decisions on OCO/GWOT designations will affect how much agency funding is available for military operations and foreign affairs activities overseas, how much is subject to the BCA caps, and how much is incorporated into regular budgets and long-term budget projections."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Report on War-Related and Emergency Funding Oversight**  \n\nThis report examines oversight issues related to war-related and international emergency funding since Fiscal Year (FY) 2001, with a focus on Department of Defense (DOD) budget mechanisms such as base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. Key legislative mandates, reporting requirements, and critiques of transparency in defense spending are highlighted.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **OCO Funding and Reporting Requirements**  \n   - Since FY2010, DOD has submitted annual budget requests that include both base budget and OCO funding.  \n   - The **National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2018 (P.L. 115-91)** requires quarterly \"Cost of War\" reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), detailing obligations for contingency operations.  \n   - Additional reporting mandates under **P.L. 115-245 (2019)** require DOD to disclose incremental costs for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the U.S. Central Command area, along with expenditure data for security cooperation programs.  \n\n2. **Critiques of Cost Reporting**  \n   - Observers note limitations in DOD’s Cost of War reports, including incomplete cost accounting, restricted data access, and formatting inconsistencies that hinder reconciliation with budget documents.  \n   - The GAO (2017) warned that without reliable OCO cost estimates, policymakers lack a full picture of future funding needs, impairing budget decisions.  \n\n3. **Budgetary Challenges**  \n   - OCO funds have been criticized as a \"budget gimmick\" for covering base budget needs, a concern echoed by former budget officials.  \n   - Discrepancies exist in OCO funding figures (e.g., FY2019 requests varied between documents), with unclear breakdowns of included activities.  \n\n4. **Legislative and Expert Recommendations**  \n   - The **National Defense Strategy Commission (2018)** urged reforms to OCO and Budget Control Act (BCA) constraints, emphasizing strategic financial planning.  \n   - Congress has historically required DOD to justify contingency operation costs exceeding $100 million or involving 1,000+ personnel (**P.L. 110-116, 2008**).  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe report underscores ongoing transparency and accountability challenges in war-related funding. While legislative measures have improved reporting, gaps persist in cost estimation and data accessibility. Policymakers must balance operational needs with fiscal responsibility, ensuring OCO funds are used as intended rather than as a workaround for base budget shortfalls.  \n\n*(This summary references CRS reports and prior research by defense policy analysts.)*  \n\n---  \n**End of Summary**",

      "First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects. Air Force officials plan to complete cost estimates for those two projects in conjunction with their fiscal year 2020 budget submission."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Report on Radar Systems and Ballistic Missile Defense Capabilities**  \n\nThis report evaluates the capabilities, operational status, and funding plans for key radar systems—specifically the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) and Cobra Dane—used in ballistic missile defense (BMD). The findings are based on reviews of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) studies, Air Force reports to Congress, and U.S. Strategic Command briefings.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n\n1. **Radar Capabilities:**  \n   - Both LRDR (to be operational at Clear Air Force Station) and Cobra Dane can track and classify missile threats. However, the Air Force inaccurately reported that both systems can assess whether a missile threat has been intercepted. MDA clarified that Cobra Dane lacks this capability.  \n   - Once operational, LRDR will uniquely discriminate between missile threats and decoys, enhancing BMD effectiveness. Its location also allows extended tracking of missile trajectories compared to Cobra Dane.  \n   - The Space Fence will provide capabilities similar to Cobra Dane, per U.S. Strategic Command.  \n\n2. **Operational Performance and Maintenance:**  \n   - Cobra Dane maintained 91% operational availability from 2016–2017, exceeding the 90% requirement. Recent declines were attributed to extended scheduled maintenance.  \n   - The Air Force and MDA plan to jointly fund Cobra Dane’s operation, maintenance, and three modernization projects, totaling $278.6 million (FY2019 budget). Only one project (transmitter group replacement) has a finalized cost estimate; the other two will be detailed in the FY2020 budget.  \n\n3. **Shemya Island Sustainment:**  \n   - The Air Force allocated $140 million (FY2019) for sustaining access to Cobra Dane’s site on Shemya Island, with costs shared between Air Force Space Command and Pacific Air Forces.  \n\n### **Agency Coordination and Corrections:**  \n   - The Air Force and MDA acknowledged the error regarding Cobra Dane’s interception assessment capability after GAO review.  \n   - Agencies may expedite modernization projects if downtime remains minimal.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe report underscores LRDR’s future advantages in missile discrimination and highlights funding and maintenance plans for Cobra Dane. It also identifies discrepancies in congressional reporting, emphasizing the need for accurate capability assessments. The findings were submitted to key defense officials, with no objections from the Department of Defense.  \n\nFor further details, the full report is available on the GAO website: [http://www.gao.gov](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n**GAO Contributors:** Kevin O’Neill (Assistant Director), Scott Bruckner, Vincent Buquicchio, Martin De Alteriis, Amie Lesser, and Richard Powelson.  \n\n---  \n*End of Summary*",

      "The federal government owns billions of dollars of personal property—such as office furniture, scientific equipment, and industrial machinery. By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years. OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property. OMB did not comment on GAO's recommendation."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Report on Personal Property Management and Disposal**  \n\nThis report examines how selected federal agencies assess the need for personal property and dispose of unneeded items, including the impact of space reduction initiatives like *Freeze the Footprint* and *Reduce the Footprint*. The review excluded certain property types (e.g., aircraft, vehicles) due to prior GAO work.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Property Assessment:** Agencies evaluate personal property needs through policies aligned with federal regulations, GSA guidelines, and asset management standards (e.g., ASTM). Some inconsistencies in data accuracy were noted, but overall, space reduction figures were deemed reliable for this analysis.  \n2. **Disposal Process:** Unneeded property must be reported to GSA promptly. If not donated within 5 days after a 21-day screening period, it may be sold publicly or ultimately abandoned/destroyed (details in Appendix II). Agencies employed varied strategies—some sold excess furniture initially but later recycled or discarded items, possibly due to distributed space reductions across departments.  \n\n### **Methodology:**  \n- Reviewed federal statutes, prior GAO/Inspector General reports, and agency policies (including NASA/DOE benchmarks).  \n- Analyzed OMB’s public data on space reduction initiatives, validating figures with agency officials.  \n- Interviewed OMB and agency staff on disposal processes, though data limitations (e.g., untracked excess from space projects) prevented independent verification.  \n\n### **Stakeholder Feedback:**  \nDraft reports were shared with OMB, EPA, GSA, IRS, Forest Service, and HUD. Only technical clarifications were provided; no substantive objections were raised.  \n\n### **Recommendations & Distribution:**  \nThe report recommends improving disposal strategies and data tracking. It is being disseminated to relevant congressional committees, agency leaders (e.g., GSA, OMB), and is publicly accessible on GAO’s website.  \n\n**Contributors:** David J. Wise (Director), Nancy Lueke, Travis Thomson, and team (listed in Appendix III).  \n\n*For further details, contact GAO’s Congressional Relations or Public Affairs offices.*  \n\n---  \n**Word Count:** ~300 | **Format:** Concise, structured overview for policymakers.",

The heavily edited video, taken from a surveillance camera, shows a car coming under fire during what the military describes as a series of ambushes that left four soldiers and six suspects dead in Palmarito on May 3. As soldiers surround the vehicle, its occupants exit and are forced to lie down in front of the car. Soldiers are then seen dragging a suspect to the same spot.

Initially, police claimed to have arrested four suspects linked to up to 60 murders, reviving the Andean legend of \"Pishtacos\"—mythical killers who harvest human fat. Authorities held a press conference displaying bottles of purported human fat and gruesome evidence, including body parts from a shallow grave.

Medical experts and anthropologists debunked the claims, stating that human fat has no commercial value in cosmetics and spoils too quickly for such use.

The suspects, still in custody, were likely using the fat to intimidate rivals in a crime-ridden region.

Anthropologists argued that investigators had foolishly relied on folklore to explain the crimes, while observers suggested the story was part of a pattern of exaggerated or fabricated news to divert attention from pressing national problems.  \n\nThe case highlights the dangers of sensationalism in law enforcement and the media, as well as the enduring power of local myths in shaping public perception.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person.

But the company says driver Walter Huang \"received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive,\" adding that \"the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\" Tesla also laid some blame on state highway officials, asserting that \"the reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced.\" The fact that the vehicle was on autopilot is likely to be controversial because, as ABC News notes, driver Huang had reportedly been concerned about it. His brother told KGO that Huang had brought his Model X back to the dealership complaining that when he used the feature, the car kept swerving toward the very same barrier that it eventually struck in the fatal collision.

His family provided investigators with an invoice documenting these concerns, though Tesla’s dealership reportedly could not replicate the issue. Tesla has defended its Autopilot system, stating that internal data shows improved reliability and that the same stretch of highway had been safely navigated by Autopilot over 85,000 times since 2015.  \n\nThe condition of the safety barrier has also come under scrutiny. Tesla released photos showing that the crash attenuator was damaged in a prior accident and had not been repaired, which may have exacerbated the severity of Huang’s crash. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) acknowledged that repairs were scheduled but delayed due to weather conditions.  \n\nTesla maintains that Autopilot enhances safety for drivers and pedestrians, but this incident has intensified debates over the system’s reliability and the adequacy of regulatory oversight.

      "Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe news passages detail the looming threat of a U.S. government shutdown amid a political standoff between Democrats and Republicans over funding legislation. Congress is working through the weekend to resolve the impasse before the midnight deadline on Monday. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has pushed to delay key portions of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and repeal a medical device tax, but Senate Democrats and President Obama firmly oppose these changes, setting the stage for a potential shutdown—the first in 17 years.  \n\nThe Senate, which reconvenes Monday afternoon, could reject the House’s amendments with a simple majority vote. While Democrats could table the amendments quickly, aides suggest no early session will be called. If no agreement is reached, a short-term funding extension might be passed to buy time. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is leading a hardline strategy to force Republicans to concede, emphasizing that funding the government and avoiding a debt ceiling crisis are non-negotiable.  \n\nA shutdown would have severe consequences, particularly for the Washington, D.C. region, where federal spending drives a third of the economy. Federal services like Medicare, Social Security, housing loans, and NIH clinical trials could face disruptions, though essential services like mail delivery would continue. Furloughs and reduced federal payrolls would further strain local businesses. Veterans' benefits may also be affected if the shutdown persists.  \n\nHistorical precedents, like the 1996 shutdowns, show widespread closures of national parks, halted visa processing, and delays in critical services. Lawmakers have ensured military personnel will be paid, but other federal employees and contractors face uncertainty. The economic and operational impacts underscore the high stakes as Congress races against the clock to avert a shutdown.  \n\n(Word count: 250)",

According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, 57-year-old Gary Simpson picked Carlie Trent up from her Tennessee school, telling staff her father had been in an accident. Shortly before, he purchased a child's nightgown, bikini, girls' underwear, lipstick, and nail polish at an area Walmart. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has pictures of those items. Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt \"sick to my stomach\" when she heard about those purchases. \"I don't know what he's done to her,\" she says. \"I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\" Authorities believe Carlie is in \"imminent danger.\" Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth. \"This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,\" a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction. Shannon Trent, who hasn't had custody of Carlie in two years, says she \"always had a bad feeling\" about Simpson. \"I should have stuck with my gut,\" she tells People.

Police in Vermont say they have issued an arrest warrant for 29-year-old Jayveon Caballero, who is accused of fatally shooting Markus Austin in Montpelier early Sunday after an altercation, the Times Argus reports. Witnesses told investigators that Austin, 33, assaulted Caballero’s girlfriend, Desiree Cary, during the altercation outside a bar in the nearby city of Barre early Sunday. Police say Caballero later confronted Austin outside his apartment and shot him dead. The body was found in the parking lot of Austin's apartment complex. A Vermont State Police spokesman says Caballero, who knew Austin before the shooting, fled the town and probably the state after the shooting, WCAX reports. The police spokesman says Caballero is believed to have boarded a Greyhound bus bound for New York City on Sunday morning, which made numerous stops in other states along the way. Later Sunday, Cary, 22, was arrested on apparently unrelated charges of selling heroin and crack cocaine. With around 7,500 residents, Montpelier has the smallest population of any state capital, the AP notes.

His Smith-Corona typewriter has also garnered interest, with bids around $11,000. However, other items, such as a hand-bowed wood saw and letters to his aunt, have attracted significantly lower bids. Art historian Elyse Luray acknowledges the historical value of certain items, like the manifesto and typewriter, despite the controversial nature of the auction.

      "Oil giant BP lost $5.2 billion last year, but the company somehow saw fit to propose maximum bonuses for 2015 for its top executives, including a 20% pay increase for CEO Bob Dudley—a proposal that 59% of shareholders roundly rejected by proxy vote at Thursday's annual meeting, MarketWatch reports. The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report. This amount was bumped up from the $3 million ($1 million in cash) he received in 2014. BP's CFO was also on the list to rake in his full bonus. \"We think it sends the wrong message,\" a rep for shareholder Royal London Asset Management tells the BBC. \"It shows that the board is out of touch.\" Not only did BP suffer straight-up monetary losses as the price of oil fell, it also announced it will be getting rid of about 7,000 jobs and taking other belt-tightening measures. And the Financial Times notes that other energy company execs saw their pay slashed in 2015. But a BP spokesman says \"executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable.\" Andy Critchlow, writing for the Reuters Breakingviews blog, agrees. \"Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors,\" he writes, noting the CEO has helped the company recover from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and improved safety protocol. \"The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.\" Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP's board, says the nonbinding shareholder vote won't alter the payouts they've already decided on, but that the board will take investors' concerns into account when coming up with next year's compensation packages."

Today's unveiling is Sony's attempt to steal the spotlight, at least until Microsoft unveils its next Xbox in June at the E3 video game expo in Los Angeles. Among the PS4's revisions is an updated controller that adds a touchpad, motion control, and a \"share\" button. The controller also features a light bar, which means a new PlayStation camera can more easily track the device. Sony has struggled lately to keep up with Microsoft and other rivals such as Apple and Samsung. The company is promising nifty mobile devices, sophisticated digital cameras, and other gadgetry as part of its comeback effort. More details at Gizmodo and TechCrunch."

Built on an x86 architecture, the PS4 simplifies game development compared to its predecessor, addressing past criticisms of the PS3’s complex software environment. The redesigned DualShock 4 controller features a Vita-style touchpad, a light bar for motion tracking (eliminating the need for a separate wand), and a share button for seamless social interaction. Additionally, the controller integrates a headphone jack and works with a 3D camera accessory, offering Kinect-like motion-tracking capabilities.  \n\nGraphically, the PS4 delivers impressive improvements, with enhanced lighting, shadows, and expansive cityscapes, though not a revolutionary leap beyond current-gen consoles. A standout demo by Quantic Dream showcased real-time facial rendering, emphasizing the system’s prowess in detail and lighting. However, the PS4 lacks native backward compatibility with PS3 games.  \n\nSocial and streaming features are central to the PS4’s design. Players can pause and upload gameplay videos instantly, spectate celebrity gamers, and interact via real-name profiles linked to mobile apps. A dedicated video-processing chip enables live streaming without interrupting gameplay, while remote play allows users to continue games on other screens. The console also supports popular streaming apps like Netflix and Hulu.  \n\nSony emphasizes personalization, using player habits to predict and pre-download games, though this could prove intrusive if not well-executed. Facebook integration aims to streamline social connectivity without requiring users to rebuild their networks. Despite these reveals, Sony has not disclosed the PS4’s price or physical design, leaving some questions unanswered.  \n\nIn essence, the PS4 refines the PS3’s strengths—faster performance, better graphics, and expanded features—while pushing social and mobile integration. It represents an evolution rather than a revolution, offering a more powerful and connected gaming experience.",

Prosecutors said Cosme tried to cover up the incident, asking a father whether his child had been burned at home, ABC7 reports. They said her actions were discovered when one child's mother, an ER physician, saw the burns and demanded to see surveillance footage. Cosme's lawyer said his client \"screwed up\" but did not mean to hurt the children."

The incident occurred at one of the daycare’s four locations, which serves children aged 6 weeks to 6 years.  \n\nAccording to prosecutors, 37-year-old Veronica D. Cosme used the hot glue gun to burn the hands and arms of five 2-year-olds (three girls and two boys) while 27-year-old Susana D. Gonzalez, an assistant, watched and laughed. The children reportedly winced and whined in pain, with some sustaining circular burn marks. Cosme later attempted to apply Neosporin to one child’s injuries and allegedly asked a parent if the burns had occurred at home, possibly to cover up the incident. The abuse was discovered after an ER physician, the mother of one victim, noticed the burns and demanded a review of surveillance footage.  \n\nCosme, who brought the glue gun from home for a Christmas project, was watching 16 children at the time. Her defense attorney claimed she “screwed up” but did not act maliciously, citing her 12 years of experience working with children. However, prosecutors emphasized the severity of the act, and Cosme was denied bail during her court appearance. Gonzalez faces misdemeanor charges for endangering the children. Both employees were immediately terminated.  \n\nThe daycare stated it reported the incident to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), which is investigating. The facility emphasized that student well-being is a priority. Cosme’s next court hearing is scheduled for December 26. The case has drawn significant attention due to the disturbing nature of the allegations and the vulnerability of the victims.  \n\n(Word count: 250)",

      "Unnamed officials say TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes at LAX before being taken to an ambulance. For 28 of those minutes, alleged shooter Paul Ciancia was in police custody, though officers hadn't yet declared the area safe to enter. Officers checked on Hernandez, who was just 20 feet from an exit, then moved on while paramedics waited 150 yards away, the AP reports, noting it's not clear if immediate attention might have saved Hernandez's life. Now under review: the conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter, and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier. While an officer who checked on Hernandez about 5 minutes after he was shot told numerous officers he was dead, the AP reports that it's not known whether that officer had the training needed to make that determination; no first-aid was administered. \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" an LAX employee says. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" The results of the investigation could be months away, the AP adds.

The alleged gunman, 23-year-old Paul Ciancia, entered Terminal 3 with an assault rifle and began shooting, targeting TSA officers. Authorities found a note in his bag expressing his intent to \"kill TSA\" and criticizing their security procedures as unconstitutional. Ciancia was shot four times by airport police and taken into custody.  \n\nA key issue raised in the investigation was the delayed medical response to Hernandez, who lay wounded for 33 minutes before being transported to an ambulance. Despite the gunman being subdued within five minutes, poor coordination between law enforcement and emergency responders may have contributed to the delay. Surveillance footage showed no officers providing immediate first aid. Experts, such as Dr. Lawrence E. Heiskell, emphasized the critical need for rapid lifesaving measures in such situations.  \n\nFurther reports revealed deficiencies in first aid training among Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers. An audit found that only a small fraction of officers had received required refresher training, though airport police were properly trained. Meanwhile, fire department protocols typically require waiting for police to secure a scene before responding, but active shooter situations demand faster intervention.  \n\nIn a related update, Ciancia’s condition was upgraded from critical to fair at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. On the same day, a public memorial was held for Hernandez, the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty. Ciancia faces charges that could carry the death penalty.  \n\nThe incident has prompted discussions about improving interagency coordination, emergency response protocols, and officer training to prevent similar tragedies in the future.  \n\n*(Word count: 250)*",

      "Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages on Mars’ Ancient Ocean**  \n\nRecent discoveries by NASA and international astronomers have revealed compelling evidence that Mars once hosted a vast ocean, reshaping our understanding of the planet’s ancient climate and potential for habitability. Studies using powerful infrared telescopes—including the Keck II, NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope—mapped Martian atmospheric water vapor over six years. The findings, published in *Science*, indicate that an ocean covering approximately 20% of Mars’ surface (comparable to the Atlantic Ocean’s coverage on Earth) existed around 4 billion years ago. This ocean was at least a mile deep in some regions and could have enveloped the entire planet in a layer 137 meters deep if evenly distributed.  \n\nThe presence of such a long-standing body of water suggests Mars was a warm, wet world with rivers, deltas, and lakes, far more hospitable than previously believed. Geronimo Villanueva, the study’s lead author, emphasized that this discovery bolsters the possibility of past habitability and the evolution of life. Michael Mumma, another researcher, noted that Mars remained wet for millions of years, significantly longer than earlier estimates. John Bridges, a planetary scientist, added that these findings shift the narrative from sporadic flooding to sustained water activity, including lakes and seas.  \n\nWhile the evidence points to Mars being habitable, whether life actually existed remains uncertain. The European Space Agency’s upcoming ExoMars rover mission in 2018 aims to further investigate this question. Some scientists, like James Kasting of Penn State, argue that the estimated water volume might be conservative, as early atmospheric conditions could have led to significant hydrogen loss, skewing calculations. Nevertheless, the growing consensus is that Mars’ ancient environment was conducive to life, strengthening the case for future exploration and the search for extraterrestrial fossils.  \n\nThese discoveries mark a paradigm shift in Martian science, highlighting the planet’s dynamic history and its potential as a former abode for life.",

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."

Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

In the English-language Wikipedia, Frank Sinatra was ranked as the most important person, while Adolf Hitler topped the list when considering all 24 major language editions. The study aimed to assess potential biases in Wikipedia’s coverage, revealing that most highlighted figures were male, from Western countries, and born after the 17th century. However, each language edition also emphasized local figures.  \n\nThe PageRank method faced challenges due to Wikipedia’s extensive documentation of named species and their discoverers, skewing results. To address this, researchers applied CheiRank, which measures importance based on outgoing links. This adjustment helped identify individuals with broad influence, leading to Sinatra’s high ranking. Meanwhile, another analysis focusing on Wikipedia’s link structure found Carl Linnaeus—the father of modern taxonomy—as the most central figure across all languages. This was due to countless scientific names linking back to him.  \n\nIn a separate but related effort, the Internet Archive is working to preserve web pages by archiving them along with their referenced links. This initiative aims to replace broken links with archived versions, ensuring historical accuracy and accessibility.  \n\nFinally, alternative studies measuring academic influence through citation analysis placed Karl Marx as history’s most influential scholar, demonstrating that different methodologies yield varying rankings of historical significance.  \n\nOverall, these studies highlight the complexities of quantifying influence and importance, whether through Wikipedia’s link structures, academic citations, or digital archiving efforts.

The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe Forbes article from December 12, 2017, investigates U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr.’s financial dealings and alleged misconduct. According to ten former employees of Ross’ private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., Ross misled colleagues and investors, leading to millions in fines, refunds, and lawsuits. Additionally, six U.S. senators accused Ross of failing to disclose 19 lawsuits during his confirmation process. Forbes raised questions about Ross inflating his net worth by including investors’ money in his personal wealth estimates. In 2011, Ross claimed a net worth exceeding $2 billion, but later reports revealed much of this sum belonged to investors. Despite these discrepancies, Ross maintained that he had complied with all legal disclosure requirements.  \n\nAfter Forbes published its findings, six Senate Democrats requested an ethics investigation into Ross’ finances. The Commerce Department denied a reported $2 billion asset transfer to a trust, contradicting Ross’ own earlier statements. The article highlights a pattern of misleading claims, raising ethical concerns about Ross’ transparency.  \n\nThe second part of the passage shifts focus to President Trump’s controversial statements, including remarks about Megyn Kelly, his physical appearance, and his dismissal of sexual assault allegations as \"locker room banter.\" Trump also criticized Hillary Clinton as \"a nasty woman\" and made inflammatory comments about abortion. During his inauguration speech, he vowed to end government corruption, claiming Washington elites had long exploited the system.  \n\nOverall, the news passages reveal ethical and financial controversies surrounding Wilbur Ross and highlight President Trump’s divisive rhetoric, underscoring ongoing scrutiny of high-ranking U.S. officials.  \n\n(Word count: 250)",

      "OJ Simpson's big moment has arrived. A hearing is underway at which he is trying to convince members of the Nevada Board of Parole that he should go free. \"I haven't made any excuses in the nine years that I've been here and I'm not trying to make an excuse now,\" said the 70-year-old Simpson early in the proceedings, per the AP. Later, he added, \"I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\" He also appeared to stifle a sob in his appeal to the board. Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\""

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\n**Passage 1: O.J. Simpson’s Parole Hearing and Legacy**  \nThe first passage discusses O.J. Simpson’s parole hearing, which drew widespread media attention reminiscent of his infamous 1995 murder trial. Simpson, a former NFL star and actor, was acquitted in the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman but later imprisoned for a 2007 Las Vegas armed robbery. His parole hearing reignited public fascination with his controversial life, from his football career to his legal troubles. The case, described as a bizarre mix of crime and celebrity, included secret recordings and a memorabilia heist. Simpson’s legal team argued his harsh sentence was retribution for his acquittal in the murder trial. The coverage underscores how Simpson’s story remains a cultural touchstone, reflecting broader societal issues.  \n\n**Passage 2: Internet Archive’s Mission to Preserve Broken Links**  \nThe second passage highlights the Internet Archive’s initiative to combat broken links by archiving web pages as they appear when first published. The project aims to save referenced pages, ensuring that even if original content is altered or removed, an archived version remains accessible.

      "The US has sent two warships to the Black Sea and put planes on standby in Europe as it prepares to evacuate its Olympians from Sochi in the event of an attack. But officials fear their preparations might not be enough, reports NBC News, which describes the effort as \"logistically mind-boggling and diplomatically delicate.\" The big issue: The US can't do much without Russian permission, and it doesn't expect to get that. \"Something that looks like the US cavalry riding to rescue Russia … well, it's just hard to imagine that happening,\" one Russian expert said. The US skiing and snowboarding teams have signed up their own private security company, Global Rescue, which claims it has six aircraft ready for an evacuation if necessary. But having planes isn't the only issue; it's having runways. Sochi's airport is fairly small, so deciding which of the 85 countries competing to use it would be a nightmare. Other teams are also taking special security precautions, the Moscow Times reports. Britain, for example, is sending extra security personnel with its delegation. A German spokesman, meanwhile, said the country trusted Russia, but would \"look closely\" at the situation. \"We will have no aircraft, that is all that I can say.\""

      "Frightened North Carolinians fleeing Irene are jamming highways as the East Coast steels for what could be the biggest hurricane in decades. At least seven states have now declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of flights are being canceled. Gas stations are running out of fuel and ATMs have been emptied of cash as Americans hit the road for a bumper-to-bumper trip out of Irene's angry path. The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today.

      "Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)"

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News on Cigarette Smoke and MRSA Resistance**  \n\nA study published in *Infection and Immunity* by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine reveals that cigarette smoke exacerbates the virulence and resistance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA). Led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, the research demonstrates that cigarette smoke acts as a stress signal to MRSA, prompting the bacteria to strengthen its defenses.  \n\nThe study found that exposure to cigarette smoke alters MRSA’s cell walls, making the bacteria more resistant to antimicrobial peptides—natural immune system components that puncture bacterial cells. This adaptation not only helps MRSA evade immune responses but also increases its invasiveness in human cells and lethality in mice. Comparative experiments showed that cigarette smoke had a more pronounced effect than e-cigarette vapor, though the latter still marginally heightened bacterial aggression.  \n\nThe findings challenge the conventional view that cigarette smoke harms smokers solely by damaging their respiratory and immune systems. Instead, the study suggests smoke also directly empowers pathogens like MRSA, worsening infections. This dual mechanism—harming host defenses while boosting bacterial resilience—explains why smokers are more susceptible to infectious diseases.  \n\nThe research builds on prior work by Crotty Alexander’s team, including a 2017 study on e-cigarette vapor’s impact on bacterial resistance. Collaborators included scientists from UCSD, the VA San Diego Healthcare System, and international institutions. Funding was provided in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  \n\nIn conclusion, the study underscores a dangerous feedback loop: cigarette smoke weakens human immunity while simultaneously enhancing MRSA’s survival tactics, compounding health risks for smokers. These insights highlight the broader public health implications of smoking in the context of antibiotic-resistant infections.  \n\n*(Word count: 250; fits one page when formatted appropriately.)*",

Shannon Egeland, 43, was already facing 10 years for taking part in a vast mortgage-fraud scheme when he had his 17-year-old son shoot him by a road in Caldwell, Idaho, in an attempt to avoid prison. \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,\" US attorney Scott Bradford wrote in a sentencing memo. Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle. Facing prison, Egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs. Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't.

      "Own a Samsung smart TV? Then take note: Your television is not only listening, it's sending your data to a third party, the Independent reports. The TV's voice-recognition software lets you give it orders, but the product's privacy policy warns that \"personal or other sensitive information ... will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\" Samsung tells the BBC that the third party is Nuance, the company that does Samsung's speech-to-text conversion. But intellectual property lawyer Corynne McSherry says it would be nice to see that clarified in Samsung's policy, the Daily Beast reports. \"And I’d definitely like to know whether my words were being transmitted in a secure form,\" she says. An activist tweets that Samsung's policy sounds a lot like the description of \"telescreens\" in George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984—which reads in part, \"Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by [the screen].\" Unnervingly, it wasn't clear how often \"the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.\" Samsung, however, says it doesn't keep voice data, and customers can opt to turn off voice-recognition or even unplug the TV from Wi-Fi. And Samsung isn't alone: the Verge reports that XBoxes already use voice recognition while being connected to the Internet. \"Samsung's privacy policy is not unique; its rhetoric just happens to be similar to that of a well-known sci-fi novel,\" the Verge says."

The company’s policy clarifies that while spoken words are not collected by Samsung, the data is sent to third-party services for processing. This includes sensitive or personal information, raising comparisons to Orwellian surveillance, as noted by digital rights activist Parker Higgins. Additionally, Samsung collects associated text inputs and usage data to improve performance.  \n\nThe SmartTV also gathers extensive user data to provide personalized content recommendations. This includes viewing history, app usage, search queries, clicks on interactive buttons, IP addresses, and device information. If enabled, the TV may also track video streams, channels, and network data to refine recommendations. Gesture control usage is recorded for performance evaluation, while facial recognition data is stored locally but not transmitted.  \n\nFor fitness services, users can create profiles with personal details like height and weight, which can be deleted at any time. Samsung’s Kids Services avoids collecting personal data from children under 13 without parental consent. However, third-party content providers may still collect device and usage data, prompting users to review external privacy policies.  \n\n**Microsoft Xbox One’s Always-Listening Feature**  \nMicrosoft’s Xbox One announcement revealed a controversial feature: the console remains in a listening mode even when turned off.

      "The three American hikers detained by Iran weren’t captured in Iraq, says Sarah Shourd: They were beckoned over the border by an armed soldier, she tells the New York Times in an effort to set the WikiLeaks version of the story straight. “We did not actually enter Iran until he gestured to us. We were confused and worried and wanted to go back.\" In Shourd's fullest account of her ordeal to date, she goes into detail about their fateful overnight camping trip, describing \"scores of campfires\" near the waterfall they were hiking to—which abutted Iran. “I think we were extremely unlucky,” says Shourd. “I guess I never believed there would be so many hundreds of people close to a border.” Her interview with the Times comes ahead of a court date for her fellow hikers, which was set for Saturday but has been delayed by Iran until Shourd “can return to Iran or,” if she refuses, her case can “be dealt with differently,” said an Iranian official. But her lawyer says the trial should go forward; neither he nor Shourd, he tells Reuters, were notified of the change."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe news passages detail the ongoing legal and diplomatic tensions surrounding the arrest and trial of three American hikers in Iran, as well as the broader geopolitical context involving U.S.-Iran relations.  \n\nIn **Passage 1**, Iranian authorities postponed the trial of two Americans, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, who were arrested near the Iraqi border in July 2009. The delay was attributed to the absence of a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, whose case would be handled separately if she did not return to Iran. Their lawyer, Masoud Shafiee, expressed frustration, stating that no official notification had been given, and insisted the trial should proceed as scheduled. The postponement comes amid stalled nuclear negotiations between Iran and Western powers, with Iran expressing willingness to resume talks but refusing to focus solely on its nuclear program. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had previously suggested a potential prisoner swap involving Iranians detained in the U.S., including a woman who claimed to have been tortured while imprisoned for arms trafficking.  \n\n**Passage 2** provides additional context on the hikers' arrest, disputing claims from a leaked U.S. military report that suggested the Americans intentionally crossed into Iran to provoke publicity. The State Department maintained uncertainty about the exact circumstances of their capture. Sarah Shourd recounted their experience, describing a peaceful hiking trip in Iraqi Kurdistan before being detained by Iranian guards near an unmarked border. She denied reports that shots were fired and emphasized that the guards initially assured them there was \"no problem\" before preventing their escape.  \n\nThe case highlights the strained U.S.-Iran relations, with Iran leveraging the detainees in potential diplomatic exchanges while the U.S. demands their release. The situation remains unresolved, with legal proceedings delayed and diplomatic efforts complicated by broader disputes over Iran’s nuclear program and alleged mistreatment of prisoners on both sides.  \n\n(Word count: ~300)",

While Forbes is concerned about what's to become of the diminutive reality star's \"brand,\" others are worried about the drinking habits of the pregnant 24-year-old, who seems to spend very few minutes sober on Jersey Shore. \"Is there a test for fetal alcohol syndrome at three months in utero?\" wonders crabbygolightly.com. \"Quick, word association test,\" demands studybreaks.com, \"because all that comes to mind\" for the pregnant \"diva of debauchery\" is \"fetal alcohol syndrome\"—a leading cause of mental retardation. The reported pregnancy poses problems for Snooki and JWoww's spin-off, and for Jersey Shore, where the cast spends \"approximately 97.2% of their time being absolutely trashed,\" notes studybreaks. Snooki has some qualms about her hard-partying ways, once telling Ellen DeGeneres: \"I want to remember my night, and sometimes I just don't. It sucks. You're like, 'What did I do?

Below is a condensed summary of the key points:  \n\n1. **Celebrity Pregnancy and Media Speculation (Passage 1 & 4)**  \n   - Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, a reality TV star from *Jersey Shore*, is reportedly pregnant, according to unnamed sources in the *New York Post*. The news has caused delays in production for her show, with speculation that she may announce the pregnancy in a tabloid like *US Weekly* for financial gain.  \n   - Snooki is known for her partying lifestyle, having previously been fined for disorderly conduct due to alcohol-related incidents. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, she admitted to frequently overdrinking, sometimes to the point of blacking out, though she acknowledges the downsides of her reckless behavior.  \n\n2. **Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) (Passage 3)**  \n   - The passage discusses the risks of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, which can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level high enough to cause FASD can be reached by a 55 kg woman consuming six to eight beers in one sitting.  \n   - Advocacy and developmental models are recommended for supporting individuals with FASD, including interventions in education (e.g., IEPs) and raising awareness among caregivers and institutions. Historical references, such as Biblical warnings against maternal drinking, suggest long-standing recognition of alcohol's harm during pregnancy.  \n\n3. **Social Trends in Motherhood (Passage 1)**  \n   - A *New York Times* report highlights that young, single women are the fastest-growing demographic of new mothers, though this trend is overshadowed in media by celebrity stories like Snooki’s pregnancy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe news passages blend entertainment gossip with serious health and social issues. While Snooki’s pregnancy and partying lifestyle attract tabloid attention, the discussion on FASD serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of excessive alcohol use, particularly during pregnancy. Meanwhile, broader societal trends, such as the rise in single motherhood, receive less media focus compared to celebrity narratives.  \n\n(Word count: ~300)",

      "\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages on Chocolate Trademark Disputes**  \n\nThe European Court of Justice recently dismissed an appeal by Nestlé regarding its claim to trademark the four-finger shape of its KitKat bars. This decision could end the snack’s protected status in Europe, opening the door for competitors like Norway’s Kvikk Lunsj and supermarket own-brand imitations. Nestlé had argued that the shape was distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection, but the court ruled that the EU trademark office must reconsider its decision, effectively annulling KitKat’s claim. Neither Nestlé, rival Mondelez (which produces similar four-finger bars like the Leo), nor the EU trademark office were satisfied with the outcome.  \n\nThe legal battle, ongoing since 2007, highlights the challenges of proving a product’s distinctiveness across all EU member states. Nestlé and the trademark office contended that such a high standard would be nearly impossible to meet. The case now returns to the EU trademark office, which may reassess evidence, such as whether the shape is recognized in more countries.  \n\nThis ruling parallels other chocolate-related trademark disputes in Europe. For instance, Lindt faced challenges over its gold-wrapped Easter bunnies with red ribbons, while Toblerone’s triangular shape sparked a legal debate with Poundland in the UK. These cases underscore the complexities of protecting product shapes and packaging in a diverse market.  \n\nAdditionally, the KitKat dispute mirrors a separate legal clash in the UK, where Nestlé contested Cadbury’s trademark for the purple packaging of its Dairy Milk bars. The outcome of these cases could set important precedents for brand protection in the EU single market, where national differences in product recognition pose significant hurdles.  \n\nThe prolonged legal saga has drawn attention from trademark experts, who see broader implications for multinational companies operating across Europe. While the future of KitKat’s shape trademark remains uncertain, the ruling emphasizes the difficulty of enforcing such protections uniformly. The case also reflects the competitive and highly litigious nature of the global confectionery industry.  \n\n(Word count: 298)",

      "Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe three news passages cover topics ranging from theoretical astrophysics to digital archiving and advanced alien civilizations.  \n\n**Passage 1** discusses a provocative theory by Russian astronomer Dan Hooper, proposing a method for a civilization to dominate the universe by harvesting energy from stars. The process involves three steps: utilizing a planet’s resources, harnessing energy from the nearest star, and eventually collecting energy from all stars in a galaxy before expanding to others. Hooper’s paper, published on arXiv.org (though not yet peer-reviewed), suggests that dark energy’s accelerating expansion of the universe will eventually make distant stars unreachable, making energy harvesting a necessity for advanced civilizations. The passage also explores the concept of Dyson spheres—swarms of solar-powered satellites—as a means to capture stellar energy. Additionally, astronomers could detect alien civilizations by observing stars being dragged across galaxies or galaxies stripped of their stars.  \n\n**Passage 2** introduces WARCZone, a repository of web archive files (WARCs) uploaded by external contributors to the Internet Archive. These files may or may not be integrated into the Wayback Machine but remain accessible for public reference and research. The collection aids the Wayback Team in organizing data while providing transparency for users seeking archived web content.  \n\n**Passage 3** delves deeper into the concept of Dyson spheres, referencing science fiction author Olaf Stapledon’s 1937 novel *Star Maker*, which envisioned energy-trapping structures around stars. Physicist Freeman Dyson later formalized the idea in 1960, proposing that a Type III civilization (one capable of harnessing a galaxy’s energy) could deploy millions of solar-collecting satellites, or \"statites,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a home planet. The passage also notes the cultural impact of Dyson spheres in science fiction, such as in *Star Trek: The Next Generation*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThese passages highlight humanity’s fascination with advanced technology, cosmic expansion, and digital preservation. From theoretical astrophysics to practical web archiving, the topics reflect both scientific curiosity and the imaginative exploration of future possibilities. Whether discussing alien megastructures or preserving internet history, these stories underscore the intersection of innovation, speculation, and information management.  \n\n*(Word count: ~300, fitting within a one-page summary.)*",

      "With George HW Bush dead at 94, coverage of the life of the 41st president is plentiful. Here are some early highlights: The broad strokes: For a thorough obituary and assessment, start with the Washington Post. Its story notes that while Bush served just one term as president, it was a consequential one. \"The Berlin Wall fell; the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the communist bloc in Eastern Europe broke up; the Cold War ended.\" And Bush's \"firm, restrained diplomatic sense helped assure the harmony and peace with which these world-shaking events played out, one after the other.\" Great detail: In its obituary, the Wall Street Journal notes that Bush flew 58 missions in the Pacific as a Navy pilot in WWII, all with the name of his girlfriend—Barbara—on the side of the plane. He once got shot down, with this video capturing the rescue. Bush is also the only American besides John Adams to be both president and the father of a president.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe provided news passages cover a range of topics, including the political career and legacy of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, notable quotes from his presidency, and a brief note on a web archiving project.  \n\n**Passage 1** focuses on George H.W. Bush’s post-war life, political career, and vice presidency under Ronald Reagan. After returning from war, Bush married Barbara Pierce, completed his education at Yale, and entered public service rather than pursuing Wall Street opportunities. He held key roles such as Republican National Committee chairman, envoy to China, and CIA director. As vice president, his leadership was tested after the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan, where he steadied the nation. However, his famous \"Read my lips: No new taxes\" pledge later damaged his presidency. Bush was more comfortable in foreign affairs, promoting a \"new world order,\" and remained influential behind the scenes in later years, including supporting his son Jeb Bush’s political ambitions.  \n\n**Passage 2** compiles significant quotes from George H.W. Bush’s career, illustrating his political philosophy and key moments. His 1988 \"Read my lips\" tax pledge became infamous, while his 1989 inaugural address emphasized freedom and free markets. Other quotes include his defense of Clarence Thomas’s Supreme Court nomination, his commitment to public service without seeking attention, and his strong support for the CIA. Later in life, he reflected on learning from Reagan, working with former rival Bill Clinton on humanitarian efforts, and humorously avoiding endorsing his son George W. Bush’s presidential campaign.  \n\n**Passage 3** briefly describes a web archiving project by Mark Graham, utilizing the Internet Archive’s Archive-IT service. The collection includes captures from ISKME.org and IGC.org-hosted sites, made available to the public for research and reference.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The first two passages highlight George H.W.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\n**Passage 1: Fast Cash Loans and Emergency Financial Assistance**  \nThe first passage discusses the availability and implications of fast cash loans, particularly for individuals facing urgent financial needs. These loans, such as 1-hour or 2-hour no-credit-check options, provide quick access to funds for emergencies like medical bills, utility payments, or unexpected expenses. However, the convenience comes at a cost—high interest rates and fees, especially if the loan is not repaid on time. The article warns against predatory lenders and emphasizes the importance of borrowing only what is necessary to avoid excessive interest charges.  \n\nApplicants can use these loans for various purposes, including debt consolidation, rent, or education expenses. The loans are available in small amounts (typically between £80 and £1,500) with short repayment terms (one to four weeks). For approval, UK-based applicants must meet criteria such as being permanent residents, over 18 years old, employed with a minimum monthly income of £1,000, and holding an active bank account.  \n\nThe application process is streamlined, often requiring only an online form submission without a credit check. Borrowers are encouraged to apply promptly, as these loans offer a quick solution despite past credit issues. However, the passage also advises caution, suggesting that saving money in advance is a more cost-effective alternative to high-interest emergency loans.  \n\n**Passage 2: Jay’s Passion for Cars**  \nThe second passage is a lighter piece focusing on Jay’s enthusiasm for automobiles.

      "Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture. (Scientists have grown chickens with dinosaur legs.)"

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe provided news passages cover a range of topics, primarily focusing on dinosaur vocalizations, sound design in movies, and web archiving. Below is a consolidated summary of the key points:  \n\n### **Dinosaur Vocalizations: Rethinking the Roar**  \nRecent research challenges the popular depiction of dinosaurs, particularly the Tyrannosaurus rex, as roaring creatures. A study published in *Evolution* suggests that some dinosaurs likely produced closed-mouth vocalizations, similar to modern birds such as pigeons or ostriches. These sounds are low, throaty noises rather than the high-pitched roars often portrayed in films like *Jurassic Park*. The study, led by Tobias Riede, found that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved multiple times in birds, implying that large dinosaurs may have used similar methods for communication, possibly during mating displays.  \n\nThe research, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, explores the evolution of bird vocalizations and their potential connections to dinosaur sounds. Julia Clarke, a co-author, suggests that future studies will integrate fossil data, physiology, and sound modeling to reconstruct the vocalizations of extinct species, including non-avian dinosaurs.  \n\n### **Sound Design in *Jurassic Park* and *Jurassic World***  \nA behind-the-scenes look at the sound design of the *Jurassic Park* franchise reveals that filmmakers used creative techniques to bring dinosaurs to life. Rather than relying on recordings of large animals, sound designers manipulated smaller animal noises. For example:  \n- **Velociraptor sounds** were derived from a mix of tortoise mating noises, horses, and slowed-down recordings of small animals.  \n- **Brachiosaurus sounds** were created using donkey vocalizations, while its sneeze was a combination of a whale blowhole and a fire hydrant.  \n- **Baby dinosaur sounds** were crafted from recordings of owls, foxes, and other young animals.  \n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom emphasized that slowing down small animal sounds often produced more interesting and realistic effects than recordings of large creatures.  \n\n### **Web Archiving Collections**  \nA separate, unrelated passage discusses web archiving efforts by Mark Graham using the Internet Archive’s Archive-IT service. The collections include captures of ISKME.org and IGC.org-hosted sites, which are publicly accessible.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe news highlights a fascinating intersection of paleontology and pop culture, correcting misconceptions about dinosaur sounds",

      "A 12-year-old was killed and two other boys were injured after a chain link fence electrified by a live underground wire electrocuted them at a city park in Georgia. During football practice at Fleming park in Augusta on Monday, Melquan Robinson hopped a fence to retrieve a ball, WRDW reports, citing the incident report that says when he \"went to come back over the fence, he was electrocuted.\" The seventh-grader was pronounced dead later at Children's Hospital of Georgia, according to the Augusta Chronicle. Two other boys who tried to help their friend were injured and hospitalized, according to reports. The mother of one of them, David Sette, tells WRDW that her son is improving. Per the Chronicle, an adult also was injured in the incident. \"We lost a future leader. We lost a future athlete. We lost a child in our city,\" Melquan's former coach, acting as a spokesman for the bereaved family, tells the Chronicle. The oldest of three children, Melquan loved his family and was very protective of his siblings, he says. Multiple investigations into the incident are reportedly underway, with city officials looking into how the fence became electrified. Georgia Power, offering \"condolences and sympathy,\" said in a statement that the utility \"does not control or maintain the voltage\" that caused the electrocution. Melquan's family will hold a vigil Thursday at the Bernie Ward Community Center. \"This young man was where he needed to be,\" his former coach says, per WRDW. \"He was doing what he loved.\" (A medieval re-enactor was impaled in a freak accident.)"

      "Twitter has promised to take a look at its policies after some sickening abuse over her father's death forced Zelda Williams off the site. After she tweeted a touching tribute to her father, the grieving daughter received messages on Twitter and Instagram blaming her for her father's death, as well as images of her father Photoshopped to show bruises around his neck, Forbes reports. \"We will not tolerate abuse of this nature on Twitter,\" a Twitter exec said in a statement. \"We have suspended a number of accounts related to this issue for violating our rules and we are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one.\" Twitter says the changes will include \"expanding our policies regarding self-harm and private information, and improving support for family members of deceased users.\" An activist who has worked with Facebook to help protect people facing online abuse says the site needs to do more to tackle persistent abusers. \"While I am truly sorry for what the Williams family is experiencing during this time, I am concerned that it takes an event like this to bring heightened attention to a problem that so many face every day,\" she tells the Washington Post. \"As is often the case, it is Williams, the target of abuse, and not her abusers, who's left Twitter,\" she adds."

The platform stores location data but permits users to delete their location history at any time. This feature aims to enhance user engagement while maintaining privacy controls.  \n\n**Passage 2: Twitter’s Response to Online Abuse**  \nTwitter faced criticism after Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, was bullied off the platform following her father’s death. Trolls sent her abusive messages and manipulated images, prompting her to leave Twitter and Instagram. In response, Twitter suspended offending accounts and pledged to improve its policies to better handle such incidents. However, critics argue that Twitter’s existing abuse-reporting tools are insufficient, as harassers often circumvent blocks by creating new accounts.  \n\nMedia critic Soraya Chemaly and legal analyst Imani Gandy highlighted the persistent harassment faced by many users, particularly women, and called for stronger protections. Gandy recommended third-party tools like \"Block Together,\" which automates blocking and shares block lists among users. Chemaly criticized Twitter’s prioritization of free speech over user safety, warning that failure to address harassment could harm the platform’s community.  \n\n**Passage 3: Alexa Internet’s Data Donation to the Internet Archive**  \nSince 1996, Alexa Internet has donated its web crawl data to the Internet Archive.

      "The FBI is reportedly investigating a sophisticated—but unsuccessful—attempt to hack into the Democratic National Committee's voter database. The DNC learned of the attempt on Tuesday, CNN reports. The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating an incident involving an attempted cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) voter database, which was initially perceived as a sophisticated hacking attempt. The DNC, along with a cloud service provider and a security research firm, detected a fake login page designed to mimic the legitimate access portal for Votebuilder—a service hosting the party’s voter file. This fraudulent page was believed to be part of a phishing scheme aimed at stealing login credentials to infiltrate the DNC’s sensitive voter data. However, the DNC later clarified that the incident was actually an unauthorized \"simulated phishing test,\" not a genuine attack.  \n\nThe initial alarm highlighted ongoing cybersecurity threats as the U.S. approaches the midterm elections. Bob Lord, the DNC’s chief security officer, emphasized the need for vigilance, calling the voter file the party’s \"most sensitive information.\" The incident underscores broader concerns about election security, including foreign interference, social media manipulation, and vulnerabilities in voter-registration systems. Rob Joyce, former White House cybersecurity coordinator, noted that cyber threats have evolved from espionage to tools of national power projection.  \n\nMicrosoft recently reported that Russian intelligence-linked hackers targeted the U.S. Senate and conservative think tanks using fake websites. Additionally, Facebook uncovered disinformation campaigns aimed at influencing global audiences, including potential disruptions to the midterms. These developments illustrate the persistent risks of cyberattacks and foreign meddling in democratic processes, prompting heightened alertness among political and government entities.  \n\nWhile the DNC incident turned out to be a false alarm, it reinforces the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard election infrastructure against both foreign and domestic threats. The episode serves as a reminder of the evolving tactics used by malicious actors in the digital age and the importance of proactive defense strategies.  \n\n(Word count: 250)",

      "Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further. Netflix announced yesterday that it is upping the ante, offering new parents unlimited, fully-paid maternity and paternity leave for the first year after having or adopting a child. The streaming video company based in Los Gatos, Calif., also offers unlimited paid vacation, and it's all toward fostering \"a 'freedom and responsibility' culture that gives our employees context about our business and the freedom to make their own decisions along with the accompanying responsibility,\" writes Tawni Cranz, chief talent officer. The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Netflix’s Unlimited Parental Leave Policy Announcement**  \n\nNetflix has introduced a groundbreaking unlimited parental leave policy, allowing new parents to take as much time off as they need during the first year after a child’s birth or adoption. The announcement, made in a blog post by Chief Talent Officer Tawni Cranz, aligns with the company’s “freedom and responsibility” culture, emphasizing trust in employees to make decisions that benefit their families while ensuring business continuity. Under this policy, employees will continue to receive their regular pay without transitioning to state or disability benefits, simplifying the process. Parents can return to work full-time, part-time, or take additional leave as needed within the first year.  \n\nThe policy reflects Netflix’s commitment to attracting and retaining top talent by supporting employees during major life changes. Cranz highlighted that employees perform better when they aren’t stressed about personal matters, and the unlimited leave policy—paired with Netflix’s existing unlimited time-off program—aims to foster long-term dedication and focus. This move positions Netflix alongside tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, which have also expanded parental benefits to remain competitive in the industry.  \n\nWhile the policy has been praised for its inclusivity (covering both mothers and fathers) and flexibility, some caution that unlimited leave policies can present challenges. Employees must coordinate extended absences with their teams to avoid disrupting workflows, and workplace dynamics may be strained if leave is not managed carefully. Nevertheless, Netflix’s initiative marks a significant shift in workplace perks, moving beyond superficial benefits like free meals and games to prioritize meaningful work-life balance, particularly for new parents.  \n\nOverall, the policy underscores Netflix’s focus on employee well-being as a cornerstone of its corporate strategy, reinforcing its reputation as a forward-thinking employer in the competitive tech landscape.  \n\n(Word count: 250)",

      "Kim Jong Nam's assassins killed him with a banned chemical weapon, Malaysian police revealed Friday. The country's police chief said toxicology reports on swabs from the face and eyes of the exiled North Korean found VX nerve agent, which the BBC notes is classed as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated. North Korea—which is widely suspected to have been behind the killing of leader Kim Jong Un's half brother—never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention that banned VX, the AP notes. Pyongyang denies involvement and says Malaysia's investigation is full of \"holes and contradictions.\" The father of one of the two women being held, Vietnamese citizen Doan Thi Huong, tells the Times his daughter trained as a pharmacist and he has seen little of her in recent years.

He also dabbled in portrait painting but was unsuccessful in finding commissions. He exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1848 and then traveled to Europe to study landscape painting. He primarily painted in Scotland until 1852 before returning to Albany and then moving to New York City in 1853. In New York, he focused on landscape painting and opened a studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building. In 1865, he became President of the Brooklyn Academy of Design.",

    "input": "In the film, David Byrne wears a large business suit called the \"big suit\" during the song \"Girlfriend Is Better\". The suit was partly inspired by traditional Japanese theater styles and became an iconic symbol not only in the film but also for Byrne himself. Byrne explained that the idea for the suit came from a fashion designer friend who suggested that everything is bigger on stage, and he applied this concept to a businessman's suit. Film critic Pauline Kael described the suit as a perfect fit psychologically, comparing it to the costumes in Noh plays and the large suit of felt by artist Beuys. Byrne himself explained that he wore the big suit to make his head appear smaller, as he believed that music is a physical experience that the body often understands before the mind.",

    "input": "The text explains that cyclopropanones, which are three-membered ring ketones, undergo hydration to a significant extent. This is because the strained structure of the three-membered ring favors sp3 hybridization over sp2 hybridization. The addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group in cyclopropanones helps release some of the strain in the small ring, making them highly reactive electrophiles. In larger rings, the stability of hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The formation of cyclic hemiacetals is more favorable because it involves a single molecule reacting with itself, while acyclic acetals involve the consumption of two molecules. Cyclic hemiacetals also have a higher forward rate of reaction, making them more stable. Many biologically relevant sugars, including glucose, are examples of cyclic hemiacetals.",

    "input": "The text discusses the career of a wrestler named Astral who competed in the Mini-Estrella division of CMLL (Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre). Astral, despite not suffering from Dwarfism, was shorter than average wrestlers. He won the Mini-Estrella division in the 2009 CMLL Bodybuilding contest and made his wrestling debut shortly after. Astral participated in various tournaments and matches, including the Torneo Bicentenario where the winner would be promoted to compete in the regular division. Astral also competed in a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament, where losing teams advanced and faced the risk of losing their masks or hair. Astral later wrestled for the vacant Distrito Federal Lightweight Championship, won his first title in a rematch, and became the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion in 2014. He successfully defended the title six times before 2017.",

Winrod argues that international Jewish Communism aims to exterminate all Christians and that this conspiracy is not new. The book received positive reception among Christians at the time. Winrod also expressed beliefs that Jews were damned to hell and that Jesus Christ condemned them in the Bible. He spread these views through his newspaper, The Defender, which had a monthly circulation of 100,000 by 1937. It is also mentioned that some of the articles in the newspaper reproduced materials from an antisemitic news agency founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer.",

    "input": "The text discusses a composition called \"Metro Chabacano\" by Mexican composer Javier Álvarez. The composition was originally titled \"Canción de tierra y esperanza\" and was dedicated to Álvarez's parents for Christmas 1986. In 1990, artist Marco Límenes asked Álvarez to use the composition for his exhibition featuring kinetic sculptures in a metro station. Álvarez recomposed the piece and renamed it \"Metro Chabacano.\" He requested the Cuarteto Latinoamericano to play and record it. The composition is a string quartet with a tempo of 144 to 146 beats per minute and has a continuous eight-note movement with melodic solos for each instrument. Jacques Sagot described the composition as resembling the pace of the metro station, with repeated notes and violin whistles evoking the sounds of the train. The Cuarteto Latinoamericano performed the composition live at the exhibition's inauguration in 1991, and Álvarez later adapted it for a string orchestra.",

The Pandya Kingdom was attacked by Malik Kafur, the commander-in-chief of Alauddin Khalji, prompting two branches of the dynasty to flee to the west of Kerala to protect themselves. One branch settled in Poonjar, while the other branch faced many difficulties before settling in Pandalam. The Chembazhannur branch initially settled in Valliyur and later Tenkasi but faced threats of invasion, leading them to move to Puliyankudi. They eventually settled in Konni, constructing a shrine for Lord Shiva and establishing themselves as the ruling class. Due to attacks by the Cholas, they moved to Pandalam, where they established a full-fledged kingdom. The Pandalam rulers maintained friendly relations with the rajas of Travancore, particularly through their close friendship with Kunjunni Varma Thampan.",

The tenant was not alerted to the leak because the gas used in the pipeline system was odorless. The government investigation identified the property developer and the gas supplier as possibly liable, along with the owner and caretaker of the unit and the construction company that renovated the apartment. The Ayala-owned Serendra Inc. stated that it complied with regulations and promised to work with the government for improvements and adherence to any changes in regulations.

Before the match, it was announced that there would be a three-minute time limit where wrestlers were not allowed to escape the cage. Once the match began, all 12 wrestlers started fighting. Hooligan was the first to escape the cage after the time limit expired, distracting his teammate Doctor X. Ángel de Oro and Ángel de Plata both attempted to climb the cage simultaneously, but Ángel de Plata pulled his brother off so he could escape alone. Monster and Sensei were the next to escape, followed by Tiger Kid preventing his brother Puma King from escaping so he could get out himself. Ángel Azteca Jr. also climbed out of the cage to secure his mask. Puma King and Ángel de Oro initially worked together to escape, but Puma King betrayed Ángel de Oro and escaped alone. With Diamante's escape, only four wrestlers remained in the ring. Histeria abandoned Doctor X to escape the cage, and Ángel de Oro accidentally hit Fabián el Gitano, allowing Doctor X to escape the cage instead of punishing his rival further.",

    "input": "The text discusses the concept of credit rationing in a market with imperfect information. It cites the seminal work of Joseph Stiglitz and Andrew Weiss, who developed a model to show how credit rationing can be an equilibrium feature of the market. This means that a borrower may be willing to pay a higher interest rate than the lender charges, but the lender may not be willing to lend the extra funds due to lower expected profits.\n\nThe text also mentions that market equilibrium can be further enhanced by competition among lenders. In this case, lenders may be willing to accept higher risks than others, resulting in an equilibrium where borrowers who are willing to accept higher risks or pay higher rates can obtain loans. This can happen because lenders have different policies regarding adverse selection, where they face borrowers with different risk levels (types) without knowing the type of each borrower.\n\nThe main idea behind this equilibrium is that safe borrowers would not be willing to accept a high interest rate because they have a low probability of default and will likely end up paying back a large amount. On the other hand, risky borrowers may accept a higher rate because they have a lower chance of a successful project and lower chances of repayment. In this case, the cost of borrowing, or the interest rate paid, increases to account for the additional risk.\n\nThe text concludes by mentioning that when a lender restricts their lending and keeps rates lower, this assumes limited liability and supports the concept of credit rationing. However, the results mentioned in the text could still hold even with unlimited liability.",

The surviving sisters would also be heiresses. This pact was known only to a few individuals, including Leopold I and his sons. Eleonore and Wilhelmine were aware of its existence and worked to establish a public succession order. In 1712, Wilhelmine persuaded Count Seilern to give her the document, which she sent to her family's head. They then sought assistance from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz to negotiate with Charles VI. Eventually, Charles VI recognized the secret succession order in April 1713. However, just days prior, Charles had already expressed his desire to amend the pact to give his own future daughters precedence over his nieces.",

In 2009, all students admitted to the program had perfect grades, and since 2016, all students have had a score of at least 330.0 (compared to the national average of 228.7) from their grades in Swedish primary school. This is due to the high number of applications received.",

    "input": "U.S. Navy aircraft carriers launched a strike on the barracks at Vit Thu Lu and Đồng Hới, both located just north of the DMZ during the Vietnam War. However, the attack on Vit Thu Lu was canceled due to heavy clouds. The strike on Đồng Hới was carried out by 29 A-4 Skyhawks from attack squadrons VA-153 and VA-155, hitting the barracks with rockets and bombs. North Vietnamese antiaircraft gunners put up a strong defense, firing from both ashore and Swatow gunboats in the Kien River. Lieutenant Edward A. Dickson's plane was hit, and although he continued the attack, he was forced to eject and died when his parachute failed to open. Another formation of A-4s from VA-212 and VA-216 then dropped their ordnance on the camp facilities, while F-8 Crusaders suppressed antiaircraft fire. RF-8A reconnaissance aircraft later assessed the damage and found that only 22 out of the 275 buildings in the camp were destroyed or damaged.",

Pertamina, the state oil company, also signed a joint operation agreement with ExxonMobil in 2006. Under a 30-year production-sharing contract, Pertamina and ExxonMobil would each have a 45 percent interest in the block, with the remaining 10 percent going to local governments. Foreign companies, particularly from China, have invested around $8 million in various projects related to the exploration and exploitation of the oil fields. Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, the former minister and ambassador to the United States, believes that Bojonegoro and Tuban could become similar to Texas due to their abundant gas and oil resources.",

However, there was a reported case of an overdose when a single dosage of 16 mg was taken, resulting in a negative experience. Shulgin warned readers that there is little room for error in dosage with 2C-P and emphasized the importance of individual titration.

    "input": "Passage:\nAmaretto\nAmaretto (Italian for \"a little bitter\") is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur associated with Saronno, Italy. Various commercial brands are made from a base of apricot pits, almonds, or both. \n\nAmaretto serves a variety of culinary uses, can be drunk by itself, and is added to other beverages to create several popular mixed drinks, as well as to coffee.\n\nOrigin\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning \"bitter\", which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara (the  bitter almond) or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness is not unpalatable, and sweeteners—and sometimes sweet almonds—enhance the flavour in the final products.  Thus one can interpret the liqueur's name as a description of the taste as \"a little bitter\".\n\nConflation of amaro (\"bitter\") and amore (\"love\") has led to associations with romance.  \n\nOne should not confuse amaretto with amaro, a different family of Italian liqueurs that, while also sweetened, have a stronger bitter flavour deriving from herbs.\n\nLegend\n\nDespite the known history on the introduction and acceptance of almonds into Italian cuisine, newer takes on the meanings and origins have been popularized by the two major brands. Though of sometimes questionable factuality, these tales hold a sentimental place in Saronno culture: \n\nIn 1525, a Saronno church commissioned artist Bernardino Luini, one of Leonardo da Vinci's pupils, to paint their sanctuary with frescoes. As the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Luini needed to depict the Madonna, but was in need of a model. He found his inspiration in a young widowed innkeeper, who became his model and (in most versions) lover. Out of gratitude and affection, the woman wished to give him a gift. Her simple means did not permit much, so she steeped apricot kernels in brandy and presented the resulting concoction to a touched Luini.  \n\nBrands\n\nDisaronno Originale\n\nDisaronno Originale (28% abv) has a characteristic bittersweet almond taste (although it contains no almonds or nuts) and is known for its distinctive appearance. Disaronno has been in commercial production since about 1900. It claims its \"originale\" amaretto's \"secret formula\" is unchanged from 1525,  and claims the Luini tale as its own particular history. Its production remains in Saronno, but the product is sold worldwide.\n\nThe company describes its amaretto as an infusion of \"apricot kernel oil\" with \"absolute alcohol, burnt sugar, and the pure essence of seventeen selected herbs and fruits\". The amber liqueur is presented in a rectangular glass decanter designed by a  craftsman from Murano.\n\nThe product was originally named \"Amaretto di Saronno Originale\" (Original Amaretto from Saronno). It subsequently changed to \"Amaretto Disaronno\", transforming the origin of the product into a more distinctive brand name. Finally, it changed once more to \"Disaronno Originale\"; it has not marketed itself as an \"amaretto\" since 2001.\n\nAccording to the Disaronno website, their amaretto contains no almonds, and is nut-free. Therefore, it is safe for people with nut or related allergies.\n\nLazzaroni Amaretto\n\nLazzaroni Amaretto (24% abv), produced by [https://www.chiostrodisaronno.it/en/c/4-about-us Paolo Lazzaroni & Figli S.p.A.], also presents itself as the first such liqueur. It is based on an infusion of Amaretti di Saronno (macaroons), a process which imparts a \"delicate almond/apricot flavour\". Lazzaroni claim the tale of the young couple blessed by the bishop as the origin of their generations-guarded family recipe, dating it to 1718; the amaretto has been in production since 1851. \n\nOther brands\n\nMany distillers  produce their own brand of amaretto. Among them are Bols, DeKuyper, Hiram Walker, Luxardo,  Mr. Boston,  Paramount, and Phillips.\n\nUsage\n\nAmaretto serves a variety of culinary uses.\n\nCooking\n\n* Amaretto is added to desserts, including ice cream, which enhances the flavour of the dessert with almonds and complements chocolate. Tiramisu, a popular Italian cake, is often flavoured with either real amaretto or alcohol-free amaretto aroma.\n* Savoury recipes which call for it usually focus on meat, such as chicken.\n* A few shots of amaretto can be added to pancake batter for a richer flavour.\n* Amaretto is often added to almondine sauce for fish and vegetables.\n*Amaretto is often added to whipped cream.\n\nBeverages\n\nAmaretto may be served neat (by itself) or on ice. It is often added to other beverages to create several popular mixed drinks. It is also a popular choice of liqueur to add to coffee in the morning.\n\nThe following cocktails highlight Amaretto liqueur as a primary ingredient.\n* French Connection.

    "input": "Passage:\nThe Four Seasons Restaurant\nThe Four Seasons is a New American cuisine restaurant in New York City located at 99 East 52nd Street, in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan.  The restaurant is owned by the Bronfman family, Alex von Bidder, and Julian Niccolini.   \n\nOpened in 1959, the Four Seasons is associated with a number of milestone firsts in the hospitality industry.  The Four Seasons is credited with introducing the idea of seasonally-changing menus to America. It was the first destination restaurant to print its menus in English.  The Four Seasons was also the first restaurant in the US to cook using fresh, wild mushrooms.  \nIn June 2015, Aby Rosen, owner of the Seagram Building, announced that the restaurant's lease would not be extended. A new location at 280 Park Avenue was selected and a lease was signed. The Seagram Building location closed after dinner service on July 16, 2016, and the Four Seasons will move to Park Avenue. \n\nAwards and honors\n\nThe restaurant itself has been widely praised, winning the James Beard Award in 1999. The restaurant is known as much for its clientele as its food, with its Midtown location making it convenient for power lunches.\n\nDesign \n\nThe restaurant's interior, which was designed by the building's architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, has remained almost unchanged since construction in 1959. The restaurant was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as an interior landmark in 1989. \n\nOver a hundred items of serviceware were designed by L. Garth Huxtable and Ada Louise Huxtable, everything from champagne glasses to bread trays.   Today they and all of the Four Seasons Restaurant's furniture are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nFor the celebration of the restaurant's 50th anniversary, The Four Seasons hired Manhattan Architect Belmont Freeman FAIA for a full restoration of the ladies' lounge.\n\nIn popular culture \n\nIn 2009, The Four Seasons was the subject of a mockumentary and a children's book published in August 2009.  \n\nArt \n\nThe artist Mark Rothko was engaged to paint a series of works for the restaurant in 1958. Accepting the commission, he secretly resolved to create \"something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room.\" Observing the restaurant's pretentious atmosphere upon his return from a trip to Europe, Rothko abandoned the project altogether, returned his advance and kept the paintings for himself. The final series was dispersed and now hangs in three locations: London’s Tate Gallery, Japan’s Kawamura Memorial Museum and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  During the period in which Rothko worked on his murals, the Four Seasons rented Jackson Pollock's masterpiece Blue Poles from its then-owner, art collector Ben Heller.   John Logan's Tony Award-winning 2010 play Red dramatizes Rothko's time working on the Seagram Murals.\n\nFrom 1975 until 1985 four paintings by Ronnie Landfield from the collection of Philip Johnson   were installed on the wall that had been initially planned for the Mark Rothko commission.   In 1985 the artist James Rosenquist was commissioned to install a permanent mural on the wall; the Landfield paintings were returned to Philip Johnson. A major Richard Lippold sculpture is installed in the Front Bar, which hangs from the ceiling.\n\nThe large curtain designed by Pablo Picasso for the Ballets Russes ballet Le Tricorne (1919) has been hung between the Grill Room and the Pool Room since the restaurant opened. The curtain is a portion of a Picasso tapestry used as a prop for the ballet that was purchased in 1957 by Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the founder of Seagram, and installed in the entryway to the restaurant for its opening in 1959. In 2014, the curtain was removed permanently from that location, and is currently in the New-York Historical Society.  Controversy over the plans to remove the curtain existed and the Museum of Modern Art offered storage space for it if the outcome is removal.\n\nIn addition to the works on permanent public display there are other works and continuously revolving exhibitions in the dining rooms and the 52nd Street entrance walls which have included works by Joan Miró, paintings by Frank Stella, Ronnie Landfield, Robert Indiana, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, amongst several others.\nQuestion:\nWhich artist painted the 'Seagram Murals' which were originally commissioned by the Four Seasons Hotel in New York in 1958?\nAnswer:\n",

She was amusing and very sarcastic; she always had a very apt answer for Gary. Yet she was also very vulnerable. The character of Phoebe tried by patience a little.

He led the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. Throughout his life in politics and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As a member of the landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but in the last year of his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.\n(en)\nJames Thomas Brudenell, 7.

Lord Cardigan est resté célèbre pour avoir commandé la charge de la brigade légère lors de la guerre de Crimée. Au cours de la bataille de Balaklava, le 25 octobre 1854, se produit la charge de cavalerie immortalisée dans un poème de Lord Tennyson et adaptée plusieurs fois au cinéma : Lord Cardigan, à la tête du 11th Hussars, conduit ses 673 cavaliers au combat à la suite d'une mauvaise interprétation des ordres. 20 minutes plus tard, au terme d'un engagement aussi inutile que meurtrier, il laisse 113 morts et 247 blessés sur le terrain ! « C'est magnifique mais ce n'est pas la guerre », commente sobrement le général français Bosquet au vu de l'affrontement. Il meurt de blessures causées par une chute de cheval le 28 mars 1868.

But as this list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs prove, the band seemed oblivious to it all. Or, more accurately, they were well aware that they were crossing lines — they just didn’t care. Blondie came out of New York City’s punk scene, but they were more tuneful (and pop-minded) and less artsy than most of their contemporaries. From the early-’60s girl-group pop they embraced early on through the disco beats that made them stars to the groundbreaking New Wave/hip-hop fusion of “Rapture,” they rarely stayed in one place. So you’ll find a sample platter of sounds on our list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs.\n10\nQuestion:\nWhat was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?\nAnswer:\n",

As the country's chief international and domestic airport, it is definitely Southern Africa's busiest airport. It is the main airport of South African Airways as well as several other local airlines. Designated Africa's leading airport in the 2005 World Travel Awards, O.R.Tambo International Airport is a hub of convenience and comfort for travelers.\nThe airport, originally named Jan Smuts Airport, was established in 1952. Right from its beginnings, the airport gained the great privilege of receiving a De Havilland Comet jet's first commercial flight from London's Heathrow International Airport to the city of Johannesburg. In the 1970s it took part in Concorde tests as a high altitude airport. In 1994 the new South African government renamed Jan Smuts Airport to Johannesburg  International Airport and established a policy stating that airports would not be named for politicians. By 1996 Johannesburg International had taken the lead from Cairo International Airport as Africa's busiest airport. In 2004 some 15.3 million passengers passed through the airport. 27 October 2006 brought another name change to the airport. Under much criticism it was named O.R.Tambo International Airport in honor of the past ANC President.\nO.R.Tambo International Airport has 2 parallel north-south runways. The western runway is amongst the longest in the world, measuring 4,400m. The airports 6 terminals are divided into the domestic terminal, the transit terminal and the international terminal. In 2003 the domestic terminal was upgraded and reopened offering travelers greater facilities. The terminal is focused around the convenience of all its travelers with necessary amenities, easy movement and quick drop-off/pick-up zones. O.R.Tambo Airport's updated facilities include a wide variety of restaurants and shops as well as ATM's and other banking services. The airport also has an outstanding medical clinic with doctors, physiotherapists, optometrists and a dentist. Business men and women can take advantage of the great Internet connections including wireless. The relatively new parkade offers more than 5,000 parking bays. There is plenty of transport to and from O.R.Tambo International Airport including taxis, shuttles and buses. It is projected that by 2015 the airport will be handling some 24 million passengers every year.\nTags:\nQuestion:\nWhich African city is served by O R Tambo airport?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nParker's Piece\nParker's Piece is a 25 acre flat and roughly square green common located near the centre of Cambridge, England and is now regarded as the birthplace of the rules of Association Football.  The two main walking and cycling paths across it run diagonally, and the single lamp-post at the junction is colloquially known as Reality Checkpoint. The area is bounded by Park Terrace, Parkside, Gonville Place, and Regent Terrace. The Cambridge University Football Club Laws were first used on Parker's Piece and adopted by the Football Association in 1863. \"They embrace the true principles of the game, with the greatest simplicity\" (E. C. Morley, F.A. Hon. Sec. 1863). 'The Cambridge Rules appear to be the most desirable for the Association to adopt' (C. W. Alcock 1863, FA committee member and founder of the FA Cup). A statue was due to be erected in October 2013 to celebrate the 150th anniversary on the Football Association and their adoption of the Cambridge Rules, but has been delayed. \n\nThe grass is well manicured and it is known today chiefly as a spot for picnics and games of football and cricket, and serves as the games field for nearby Parkside Community College.  Fairs tend to be held on the rougher ground of Midsummer Common.\n\nIn 1838, a feast for 15,000 guests was held on Parker's Piece to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore 1613, the site of Parker's Piece was owned by Trinity College. In that year, the college exchanged the land — at that time located well outside the town — with the town of Cambridge for the majority of Garret Hostel Green, an island on the River Cam, and the site of the current Wren Library, Trinity College. It was subsequently named after a college cook, Edward Parker, who obtained the rights to farm on it.\n\nAs a cricket ground, Parker's Piece was used for first-class matches from 1817 to 1864. \n\nIn the 19th century, it was one of the principal sports grounds used by students at the University of Cambridge and the site of numerous Varsity Matches against Oxford.\n\nParker's Piece and football\n\nIn the 19th century, football was also commonly played on this ground, as is described in the following quotation from George Corrie, Master of Jesus College (1838):  \"In walking with Willis we passed by Parker's Piece and there saw some forty Gownsmen playing at football. The novelty and liveliness of the scene were amusing!\" \n\nRules of football\n\nParker's Piece has a special place in the history of modern football games, as it was here that the Cambridge Rules of 1848 were first put into practice.  They were very influential in the creation of the modern rules of Association Football, drawn up in London by The Football Association in 1863.  A plaque has been mounted at Parker's Piece bearing the following inscription: \n\nModern passing tactics\n\nThe move by the Cambridge University AFC away from Parker's Piece in 1882 coincided with the side's significant role in the development of the modern passing, combination game. In a detailed investigation into the evolution of football tactics based upon contemporary accounts, Adrian Harvey refers to the teams responsible for the early development of the passing game (including Sheffield, The Royal Engineers   and Queens Park) but comes to the following conclusion about the finished, modern team product:  \"Curiously, the side that was generally credited with transforming the tactics of association football and almost single-handedly inventing the modern game was not a professional team but the Cambridge University XI of 1882.  Contemporaries described Cambridge as being the first \"combination\" team in which each player was allotted an area of the field and played as part of a team in a game that was based upon passing\".   In a discussion by CW Alcock on the history of a \"definite scheme of attack\" and  \"elaborate combination\" in football playing style, he states in 1891:  \"The perfection of the system which is in vogue at the present time however is in a very great measure the creation of the last few years.  The Cambridge University eleven of 1882 were the first to illustrate the full possibilities of a systematic combination giving full scope to the defence as well as the attack\" \n\nProposed sculpture\n\nIn May 2013, the Cambridge City Council proposed that a 2 m statue by artist Gordon Young, in the form of a Subbuteo referee on top of a circular plinth engraved with Cambridge Rules be installed on Parker's Piece to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the 1863 Football Association rules and Parker's Piece's association with it.  The proposal was rejected in June 2013 before public consultation due to negative feedback and concerns with Hasbro, which markets Subbuteo, and the possibility of significantly exceeding its original £88,000 budget. \n\nTrial lighting\n\nFor a four-week trial beginning January 2013, lighting bollards were temporarily installed along the northwest path, between Reality Checkpoint and Melbourne Place, as residents and students had claimed that Parker's Piece was unsafe after dark. Several attacks had previously occurred in the park.  \n\nParkside\n\nParkside is the street on the north-east side of the park. Since 2006  it has been the terminus for long distance coach services (such as the Stagecoach bus route X5 to Oxford), visitor coaches and a stopping point for local bus services. The street is also home to the city's police station, as well as giving access to Parkside Community College.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:ISH WC Cambridge15.jpg|Looking towards Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church\nImage:Cambridge_Parkers_Piece_Catholic_Church.jpg|The Catholic church of Our Lady and the English Martyrs viewed from Parker's Piece.\nImage:Cambridge_Race_For_Life_2011_Parkers_Piece.jpg|Race for Life 2011 at Parker's Piece.

Zadok the Priest has been sung during the anointing of the sovereign at every Coronation of the British monarch since 1727.\n\nText\n\nPart of the traditional content of British coronations, the texts for all four anthems were picked by Handel—a personal selection from the most accessible account of an earlier coronation, that of James II in 1685.  The text is a translation of the traditional antiphon, Unxerunt Salomonem,  itself derived from the biblical account of the anointing of Solomon. These words have been used in every English, and later British, coronation since that of King Edgar at Bath Abbey in 973. An earlier setting had been written by Henry Lawes for the coronation of King Charles II. \n\nAt the coronation itself on 11 October 1727, the choir of Westminster Abbey sang Zadok the Priest in the wrong part of the service; they had earlier entirely forgotten to sing one anthem and another ended \"in confusion\". \n\nFull text\n\nAfter 1 Kings 1:38–40\n\nZadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet anointed Solomon King.\nAnd all the people rejoiced, and said:\nGod save the King! Long live the King!\nMay the King live for ever,\nAmen, Allelujah.\n\nStructure\n\nZadok the Priest is written for SS-AA-T-BB chorus and orchestra (two oboes, two bassoons, three trumpets, timpani, strings (with three violin parts rather than the usual two), continuo). The music prepares a surprise in its orchestral introduction through the use of static layering of soft string textures followed by a sudden rousing forte tutti entrance, augmented by three trumpets.\n\nThe middle section \"And all the people rejoic'd, and said\" is an imitatory dance in 3/4 time, with the choir singing chordally and a dotted rhythm in the strings.\n\nThe final section \"God save the King\", etc. is a return to common time (4/4), with the \"God save the King\" section heard chordally, interspersed with the Amens incorporating long semiquaver runs, taken in turn through the six voice parts (SAATBB) with the other parts singing quaver chords accompanying it. The chorus ends with a largo plagal cadence on \"Allelujah\".\n\nOther uses\n\n* It is regularly (sometimes daily) played by request on 'popular classics' radio stations in the United Kingdom such as Classic FM, which aired this song at its launch at 6am on 7 September 1992.\n* Used in royal weddings, including that of Mary Elizabeth Donaldson to Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark. \n*Used in a 2015 commercial for DirectTV advertising a partnership with AT&T to watch TV on mobile phones. \n* Furthermore Tony Britten rearranged Zadok the Priest in 1992. Since then this rearrangement is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the coronation anthem composed by Handel using texts from the King James Bible that has been sung at every British coronation service since 1727?\nAnswer:\n",

The gospel of John chapter 21. You know, the Bible says that Jesus spent 40 days after his resurrection from the dead on this earth. Most of that time he spent with his disciples before he went back to heaven. There were 40 days between the resurrection of Christ and the ascension of Christ. Then after the ascension of Christ there were ten more days to Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was sent by God to baptize the church into the body of Jesus. What do you imagine happened to the disciples during that 40 days of time after Jesus rose from the dead? Well, the Bible talks about five different appearances of Christ to His disciples. The Bible says that one time Jesus appeared to 500 of his disciples on one occasion, at one time. That 500 of them saw him at one time. But here in John 21, it's one of the most moving accounts of one of Jesus' post resurrection appearances.\nI would have to sum it up by saying during those 40 days following Jesus' resurrection, that Jesus, first of all, convinced his disciples he was alive. Secondly, Jesus comforted his disciples about his resurrection. He comforted them, that they had a future. Thirdly, Jesus commissioned his disciples to go out and preach the gospel to the entire world. So I would say that this passage tonight has to do with Jesus comforting, convincing, and commissioning his disciples, particularly Simon Peter. So here in the 21st chapter Jesus had victoriously and gloriously risen from the dead. Now, there was a short period of time between his resurrection and his appearance to the disciples in Galilee. Jesus had instructed them to go and wait for Him in Galilee and he said, ''Tell Peter, and the disciples that I will meet them in Galilee.'' He wanted especially Peter to know that he ...\nThere are 18882 characters in the full content.

It is located at the northeast end of Busta Voe, on the narrow isthmus that separates the mainland from Northmavine.

The word 'Brae' in Shetland dialect has a different meaning; it may come from the Old Norse word breiðr meaning broad. The village may take its name from the broad isthmus between Sullom Voe and Busta Voe as opposed to the narrower one a little further north at Mavis Grind.

After winning a tennis scholarship to UCLA, Ashe was taken under the wing of tennis star Pancho Gonzales, who recognized the young player’s potential. In 1968, Ashe became the first black man to win the U.S. Open. Two years later, he captured the Australian Open for his second Grand Slam title. Over the next seven years, Ashe won his share of tournaments, but no more majors, and, frustrated, he set his sights on victory at Wimbledon, one of the most celebrated championships in tennis.\nArthur Ashe was 31 years old in 1975, and seemingly well past his prime, so his advancement to the 1975 Wimbledon finals came as somewhat of a surprise to the tennis establishment. While Ashe’s best finishes at Wimbledon had been losses in the semi-finals in 1968 and 1969, his opponent, the brash 22-year-old Jimmy Connors, was the defending Wimbledon champion. In their three previous meetings, Connors had handled Ashe easily. Furthermore, Connors was coming off an impressive semi-final win against Roscoe Tanner, whose intimidating serve observers called the hardest hitting ever at Wimbledon.\nThough many thought he didn’t have a chance, Ashe formulated a game plan for the match: hit nothing hard. He planned to serve strongly and then give Connors nothing but “junk” as Ashe himself described it. Connors won the first game of the first set, but then dropped the rest of the set in just 20 minutes, 6-1. Although Connors won just one game off Ashe in the second set, he took the third set 7-5. His confidence restored, Connors strutted around the court, while Ashe closed his eyes between sets, concentrating on the moment at hand. Finally, with the shocked crowd cheering him on, Ashe finished Connors off in the fourth set, 6-4.\nAshe retired from competitive tennis in 1980 after suffering a heart attack. For his career, he won 51 tournaments. In retirement, Ashe wrote the three-volume book A Hard Road to Glory, first published in 1988, which detailed the struggle of black athletes in America. In 1983, after double-bypass surgery, Ashe was infected with HIV during a blood transfusion. After revealing his disease to the world in 1992, he set about educating the public about HIV and AIDS. He died of AIDS-related complications on February 6, 1993. In 1997, the U.S. Open’s new home court was named Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWho is the only black man to win a singles title at Wimbledon?\nAnswer:\n",

Up to 180,000 spectators a day entered the Park to enjoy the Games, making it the principal focus of Olympic activity.\nThe main venues – the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre, Velodrome and BMX Circuit, as well as the hockey, handball and basketball arenas – were easily accessible through a network of footbridges and walkways within the Park.\nThe Olympic Village was within walking distance of all the venues in the Park, enhancing the experience for athletes and officials. The use of other prestigious venues – such as Wembley Stadium for football, the All-England Club in Wimbledon for tennis, Lord’s Cricket Ground for archery and Horse Guards Parade for beach volleyball – was also a feature of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nThe London 2012 Games included a four-year Cultural Olympiad.

The design also includes a ribbon representing London’s Thames river and an interlocking grid pattern that radiates from the centre and pulls the design together, giving it a sense of outreach while also representing the achievements and efforts of Olympic athletes. A square, which encases the balance of the design, opposes the circular shape of the medals and emphasizes its focus on the centre, reinforcing the sense of ‘place, as in a map inset.\nMore info\nWenlock\nWenlock takes his name from the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire, which still hosts the traditional Much Wenlock Games.

(Derr) Biggers, Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren, Ohio, and graduated from Harvard University in 1907. He worked as a journalist for The Plain Dealer before turning to fiction.   Many of his plays and novels were made into movies. He was posthumously inducted into the Warren City Schools Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\nHis novel Seven Keys to Baldpate was popular in 1913, and George M. Cohan quickly adapted the novel as a hit Broadway stage play of the same name. Cohan starred in the 1917 film version, one of seven film versions of the play, and a 1935 revival.Warburton, Eileen.

It was described by the Kololo tribe living in the area in the 1800’s as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’ – ‘The Smoke that Thunders’. In more modern terms Victoria Falls is known as the greatest curtain of falling water in the world.\nColumns of spray can be seen from miles away as, at the height of the rainy season, more than five hundred million cubic meters of water per minute plummet over the edge, over a width of nearly two kilometers, into a gorge over one hundred meters below.\nThe wide, basalt cliff over which the falls thunder, transforms the Zambezi from a placid river into a ferocious torrent cutting through a series of dramatic gorges.\nFacing the Falls is another sheer wall of basalt, rising to the same height, and capped by mist-soaked rain forest. A path along the edge of the forest provides the visitor prepared to brave the tremendous spray, with an unparalleled series of views of the Falls.\nOne special vantage point is across the Knife-edge Bridge, where visitors can have the finest view of the Eastern Cataract and the Main Falls as well as the Boiling Pot, where the river turns and heads down the Batoka Gorge. Other vantage points include the Falls Bridge , Devils Pool and the Lookout Tree, both of which command panoramic views across the Main Falls.\n*As of December 2016, the KAZA visa for entry into both Zimbabwe and Zambia is available at all major ports of entry into both countries, making it easier than ever to experience both sides of the falls.

    "input": "Passage:\nPigeon Post\nPigeon Post is an English children's adventure novel by Arthur Ransome, published by Jonathan Cape in 1936. It was the sixth of twelve books Ransome completed in the Swallows and Amazons series (1930 to 1947). He won the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising it as the year's best children's book by a British subject.\n\nThis book is one of the few Swallows and Amazons books that does not feature sailing. All the action takes place on and under the fells surrounding the Lake, as the characters attempt to discover precious metals in the Lake District hills. \n \n \n\nPlot summary\n\nThe Swallows, Amazons and Ds are camping in the Blackett family's garden at Beckfoot. The Swallow is not available for sailing. James Turner (Captain Flint) has sent word that he is returning from an expedition to South America prospecting for gold, and has sent \"Timothy\" ahead. As he can be let loose in the study, they deduce that Timothy is an armadillo and make a box for him, but he does not arrive.  Slater Bob, an old slate miner, tells them a story about a lost gold vein in the fells. As Captain Flint has been unsuccessful in his prospecting trip, plans are made to prospect for gold on High Topps instead.\n\nThe children prove they can stay in touch with Beckfoot using the homing pigeons that give the book its name, and earn permission to move camp to Tyson's Farm, up near the fells, to be closer to the prospecting grounds. They are disappointed in that Mrs Tyson does not permit them to cook over a campfire, owing to drought conditions and her fear of fires. Titty eventually finds a spring by dowsing and they move closer to the Topps. They send daily messages home by pigeon.\n\nWhile exploring the ground, they notice a rival prospector whom they call 'Squashy Hat'. After days of prospecting, they find a seam of gold-coloured mineral in an old mining excavation, and crush enough of it to produce a golden ingot in a charcoal furnace. Unfortunately it disappears when the crucible breaks and Dick Callum has only a small amount to test.  Meanwhile Squashy Hat is consulting the old slate miner, walking through beneath the fell via an old mine working.  Seeing him, the younger four children follow him, with very nearly fatal results.  Christina Hardyment writes that venturing into the Old Level was probably the most idiotic thing that any of Ransome's characters ever did.\n\nCaptain Flint returns home and finds Dick doing chemical tests on the putative gold in his study. Dick has read that gold dissolves in aqua regia, but Captain Flint explains \"Aqua regia will dissolve almost anything. The point about gold is it won't dissolve in anything else…\" He shows Dick by other tests that they have found copper pyrites, a rich copper ore.\n\nA pigeon arrives with an urgent message from Titty, FIRE HELP QUICK. Captain Flint rings Colonel Jolys who musters his volunteer fire fighters, and they all rush to help save the Topps. After the fire on the fells is extinguished, Squashy Hat is revealed to be Captain Flint's friend Timothy, who has been too shy to introduce himself to the children. Captain Flint is pleased to find copper, as he had talked with Timothy above Pernambuco in South America about new ways of prospecting for copper on the fells. Indeed, prospecting for copper, not gold, had been the purpose of the expedition to South America in the first place.\n\nThe mining project recurs in the later book The Picts and the Martyrs.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe British Library Association presented Ransome with the inaugural Carnegie Medal at its annual conference in June 1936. Notices in The New York Times recognised that as comparable to the American Newbery Medal. The following month Lippincott of Philadelphia published the first U.S. edition, which Ellen Lewis Buell reviewed for the newspaper in August. She noted the children's \"vivid collective imagination which turned play into serious business\" and observed, \"It is the portrayal of this spirit which makes play a matter of desperate yet enjoyable earnestness which gives their distinctive stamp to Mr. Ransome's books. ... Because he understands the whole-heartedness of youth he can invest a momentary experiment, such as young Roger's Indian scout work, with real suspense.\"\n\"The New Books for Boys and Girls\", Ellen Buell Lewis, The New York Times, 22 August 1937, p. BR10. Ransome made use of the mining and prospecting knowledge and experience of his friend Oscar Gnosspelius, who appears in the book as 'Squashy Hat'.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the children's books 'Pigeon Post' and 'Coot Club'?\nAnswer:\n",

According to Sammy himself, “I was in a rent-a-car that wouldn’t go much faster than 55 miles an hour…..cop stopped me for doing 62 on a four lane road when there was no one else in sight. Then the guy gave me a ticket. And he said, ‘We give tickets around here for over-60.’ and I said, ‘I can’t drive 55.’ I grabbed a paper and a pen, and I swear the guy was writing the ticket and I was writing the lyrics. I got to Lake Placid, I had a guitar set-up there. And I wrote that song there on the spot.” When the video aired on MTV it ticked off law enforcement across the country and they demanded equal TV time to show the dangers of driving fast. There is also a rumor that Hagar’s auto insurance was WAY high…$5,000 a month. I CAN’T DRIVE 55 peaked at #26 in the fall of 1984.\nQuestion:\nAccording to Sammy Haggar, what can't he drive?\nAnswer:\n",

Spark's fiction is characterized by the use of certain techniques which give her often short novels a feeling of complexity and depth. Her new novel, Aiding and Abetting, is true to form short in length and long on style. In this quirky tale of murder, blackmail and false identities, Spark widens the book's scope by using an omniscient third-person narrator and unexpected time and place shifts. These techniques, coupled with her witty, understated way of revealing unusual events, makes Aiding and Abetting a delightfully strange and surprising tale.  The inspiring \"spark\" for this story was a real-life upper-class crime story that caused a sensation in the British press. As Spark tells us in her opening Note to Readers, the real-life seventh Earl of Lucan disappeared in 1974 when he fled from charges of murder (oops he killed his children's nanny by mistake, thinking she was his wife) and attempted murder (oops again he tried once more to kill his wife but she survived his attack). Aiding and Abetting is a fiction, a fabrication of Lucan's life on the lam more of a whimsical \"where'd he go?\" than a hard-boiled \"whodunit.\"  Still, there is plenty to keep us guessing. Spark keeps the \"who?\" question alive throughout much of the story by having two nearly identical \"Lucans\" surface, each claiming to be the genuine article and each claiming patient-doctor privilege in his relationship with the psychiatrist, Hildegard Wolf, an alluring, enigmatic, former fake stigmatic from Bavaria.  These three less-than-honorable characters play cat and mouse games from start to finish. In the hands of a less-venturous novelist, they would probably provide enough entertaining, problematic entanglements by themselves, but Spark (now in her 80s) is not one to shy from a twist or a complication she'll throw a new character into the fray or pull one out of the past on a moment's notice keeping your wheels spinning. Aiding and Abetting may be unconventional in structure, it may break some rules, but you will find the pages turning quickly as you try to puzzle out this Rubik's Cube of a novel.\nLinda Stankard is a writer/actor living in Middle Tennessee who has broken a few rules herself, though with less literary acclaim.\nQuestion:\n'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' is a 1961 novel by which author?\nAnswer:\n",

His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he wouldn't see his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at fourteen, lying about his age and forging his father's signature on a letter to join Bob Pender's troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the US. Their show on Broadway, \"Good Times,\" ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--\"high comedy with polished words.\" In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, North by Northwest (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.\nQuestion:\nBritish-born American film actor Archibald Alec Leach was better known by which stage name?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nGarnish (food)\nA garnish is an item or substance used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink. In many cases, it may give added or contrasting flavor.  Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.  This is in contrast to a condiment, a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being garni, the French term for 'garnished.'  Many garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so.  Parsley is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green herb has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\nOverview\n\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.  They may, for example, enhance their color, such as when paprika is sprinkled on a salmon salad. They may give a color contrast, for example when chives are sprinkled on potatoes. They may make a cocktail more visually appealing, such as when a cocktail umbrella is added to an exotic drink, or when a Mai Tai is topped with any number of tropical fruit pieces. Sushi may be garnished with baran, a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an entrée could be topped with a sauce, as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a banana split sundae with cherries on top or buffalo wings served with celery stick garnish and blue cheese dressing.\n\nGarnishes\n\nClassic French garnishes include \n \nFor soups:\n* Brunoise - one to three mm diced vegetables\n* Chiffonade - finely shredded lettuce or sorrel stewed in butter \n* Croutes - small pieces of halved French bread buttered and oven dried\n* Coulis - (a thicker soup) drizzled decoratively\n* Croutons - small pieces of bread (typically cubes) fried in butter or other oil   \n* Julienne - thinly sliced vegetables\n* Pasta (tapioa, sago, salep) etc. \n* Pluches -a whole leaf spray of herbs, without the central stalk (traditionally chervil)\n* Profiterolles - puff pastry stuffed with purée\n* Royale - a small decoratively shaped piece of egg custard (in German this is called an Eierstich)\n* Threaded eggs\nand for relevés and entrées:\n* Croquettes\n* Potatoes (pommes dauphine, Duchess potatoes or Marquis)\n* Duxelles - fried onion, mushrooms and herbs\n* Matignon - minced carrots, onions, and celeries with ham stewed in butter and Madeira\n* Mirepoix - similar to Matignon but diced (cf. minced) with or without ham (or with bacon substituted for the ham)\n* Salpicon - a variety of other diced meats or vegetables\n* Fritters \n\nTools often used for creating food garnishes include skewers, knives, graters, toothpicks, and parchment cones. \n\n \nFile:Garnished crabcake.jpg|A crabcake with a cream sauce and a garnish of microgreens\nFile:Cheese tray garnished with red pepper rings and chicory.jpg|Cheese tray garnished with red pepper rings and chicory\nQuestion:\n\"A dish cooked \"\"a la Lyonnaise\"\" would be garnished or prepared with which ingredient?\"\nAnswer:\n",

While the film is clearly Robin William's vehicle, Kirby, playing 2nd Lt. Hauck, is the perfect comedic foil. Kirby plays the uptight Hauck, who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone, in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line \"and if you doooooo...\" when someone, e.g. my wife or children, do not seem to be listening to me intently enough. Kirby does this in a scene where he is giving instructions to his underlings, who are routinely ignoring him as they comment on things having nothing to do with his agenda. This is a great movie. Williams gives one of his best performances, and you already know how I feel about Bruno Kirby. Another newcomer in the cast is Forest Whitaker, who would later make his mark in The Crying Game and as the host of the update TV series \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n8 of 10 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nQuestion:\nWhat is Robin Williams character called in Good Morning Vietnam?\nAnswer:\n",

A school with mind, heart, guts and a constant fizz.\"\nGood Schools Guide 2016\nWhen you make your first visit to Wellington College you immediately get a sense that it is more than just a school. The beautiful grounds and breath-taking buildings see to that, as does the palpable sense of purpose among every pupil and member of staff you meet. I genuinely do not believe that there is a better coeducational boarding and day school for 13 – 18 year olds in the land.\nThe College, founded in 1853 as a living memorial to the Duke of Wellington, sought to deliver an inspirational education for all of its pupils. As the school grew, so too did the identity of those pupils. It is an identity built on intellectual curiosity, on true independence, on a generous and far-reaching inclusivity and on the courage to be properly and unselfishly individual. It is, in short, the capacity to be inspired to become the very best you can be. And it is these qualities that are present in the thousands of small interactions that happen all the time here, the little daily miracles that make this such a special place. After all, the school we build is the school we build together, and every pupil who passes through Wellington leaves an indelible mark on our community. It is my absolute responsibility to help all our pupils become the very best that they can be, and to develop the identity that marks them out as a true Wellingtonian.\nWellington College is set in 400 acres of beautiful parkland in leafy Berkshire, one hour from Central London and just 40 minutes from Heathrow. Please do explore our on-line tour to get a sense of the scope and size of the school, for our campus is quite simply stunning. Wellington’s curriculum is vibrant, demanding and progressive, and with our ground-breaking Wellbeing course and classes in Philosophy and Thinking, Wellington has become nationally renowned as a centre for curriculum development. Our stunning examination results and university outcomes speak for themselves.\nCreativity flourishes and it was no surprise when the Arts Council awarded us Artsmark Gold in recognition of the outstanding provision and standards across all the Arts at the school. We have a “premier league” reputation as one of the best schools for sport in the UK and, in recent years, our teams have achieved national renown and titles in hockey, rugby, golf, shooting, triathlon, squash, equestrianism, cricket, rackets and polo. Outward-facing in all that we do, the College’s focus on service, leadership and character education means that Wellingtonians leave the school fully prepared for the challenges of adult life in the 21st Century.\nRT @WillGreenwood: Mia!!! Awesomeness!!! http://EPg3ox7z9g\n@Welly_Master | 18 January 2017\nChoice lies at the heart of our co-curriculum and is central to developing the Wellington Identity which ensures that all our pupils are Inspired, Intellectual, Independent, Individual and Inclusive. Our pupils and our staff see every day as an opportunity, a chance to grow and a chance to learn and the journey as a life-long learner begins the moment a child starts at Wellington.\nWill you let your child join us on that journey? It could be the most inspired choice you ever make.\nJulian Thomas – 14th Master of Wellington College\nQuestion:\nIn which county is Wellington College?\nAnswer:\n",

POWERS | TIMES STAFF WRITER\nAlexander Dubcek, the silent symbol of Czechoslovakia's failed 1968 attempt to alter the hard-line course of Moscow-dictated communism, died Saturday at age 70.\nDubcek, who had been hospitalized since a car accident Sept. 1, died at a Prague, Czechoslovakia, hospital from \"failure of vital organs,\" the official state news agency CSTK reported.\nFor 21 years after a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that put down the \"Prague Spring,\" Dubcek lived in a sort of internal exile that roughly paralleled the fortunes of his compatriots: He was comfortable enough, but voiceless, in a villa outside his native Bratislava.\nNow and then, when he attended a concert, his neighbors and admirers would rise to applaud him, an act of civil disobedience on the part of the public showing that his memory--and the memory of 1968--was still alive among Czechoslovaks.\nIt was still alive in 1989, when throngs gathered in Prague's Wenceslaus Square, sensing that communism was finally on the run in Eastern Europe. The crowd chanted Dubcek's name along with that of Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who had come to symbolize the new Czechoslovak opposition.\nDubcek was always a believer in the socialist ideal. Born in 1921 in the Slovakian town of Uhrovec, near Topolcany, he grew up in Bratislava, the provincial capital. He joined the Communist Party when he was 18 years old and his country was occupied by Nazi forces. He was wounded twice fighting with Communist partisan units against the Nazis.\nAfter the war he went to Moscow, and he graduated in 1958 from Moscow's Communist Party Academy, a training ground for up-and-coming apparatchiks from throughout the Soviet Bloc. He returned to Bratislava and rose to become first secretary of the Slovak Communist Party.\nBut by the late 1960s, the Czechoslovak party was in quiet turmoil, with a younger generation of Communists in revolt against 15 years of Stalinist-style rule under the direction of party leader Antonin Novotny, who made no secret of his contempt for Nikita S. Khrushchev's attempts to ease the centralization of Communist Party power in the Soviet Union.\nThe reformers ousted Novotny in January, 1968, and chose Dubcek as their party leader. He was no firebrand reformer but was chosen as a compromise candidate, acceptable to both reformers and hard-liners.\nDubcek's desire to create \"socialism with a human face\" and the nation's desire for change triggered six months of debate and reform in 1968 that came to be known as the \"Prague Spring.\"\nCzechoslovakia's reformers sought an overhaul of the legal system, civil liberties guarantees and a more responsive system of economic planning. None of the goals, in themselves, espoused an end to the Communist system, but Moscow's leaders saw that the reformers' \"action program\" received wide public support and thus amounted to a clear threat to the Soviet system in neighboring countries.\nDuring the night of Aug. 20-21, five Warsaw Pact armies invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia. Security forces arrested Dubcek and other party leaders and flew them to Moscow. Party leaders in Prague refused to recognize the Soviet-imposed government, and after lengthy negotiations Dubcek was allowed to return home, still in his post as first secretary of the party.\nHe tried to salvage the \"action program\" of the reformers, but the atmosphere remained tense. A university student burned himself to death on Wenceslaus Square to protest the Soviet invasion, and a hostile crowd vandalized the offices of Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. In April, 1969, Dubcek was removed as party leader and given the largely ceremonial post of president of Parliament.\nEven that was not to last long. He was fired the following September and removed from the party's Central Committee. That December he was appointed ambassador to Turkey. Then in June, 1970, he was expelled from the Communist Party and brought home from Turkey. He was ejected from his seat in the Parliament's House of the People.\nDubcek then moved to Slovakia with his wife, Anna, and was given a menial job as a clerk in a forestry office.\nFrom then until 1987, when then-Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Czechoslovakia, Dubcek was kept under close surveillance. He was scarcely mentioned in the Czechoslovak press, except for the occasional historical denunciation of \"liberal\" trends in the socialist world. Foreign reporters were forbidden to visit him.\nAfter Gorbachev's rise to power in Moscow, however, the controls on Dubcek were relaxed. In 1988, on a visit to Italy, he indicated that he still held to his belief in the workability of a \"reformed\" communism, as exemplified by Gorbachev.\nQuestion:\nIn January 1968 who was chosen as leader of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia?\nAnswer:\n",

During the 19th cent. British art was poorly represented in the national collections. The 1840s and 1850s saw a number of important bequests to the nation, including that of sculptor  Sir  Francis Chantrey , who left his fortune for the purchase of ‘Works of Fine Art … [by] artists resident in Great Britain ’, and the enormous Turner bequest, which the National Gallery was unable to house adequately. In 1890 the sugar magnate  Henry  Tate gave 60 modern English paintings to the National Gallery provided that a gallery was made available. The offer was twice withdrawn as arguments delayed the provision of a suitable site and funding for a new gallery. Eventually the government offered the prison site at Millbank, London, and the Tate Gallery opened in 1897.\nWealthy benefactors have continued to aid expansion; in 1987 the Turner bequest was finally housed as the artist intended, in the extension funded by the Clore Foundation.

    "input": "Passage:\nSaint George and the Dragon (Raphael)\nSt. George and the Dragon is a small cabinet painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, painted between 1504 and 1506, and now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter, reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, by King Henry VII of England. The first word of the order's motto, \"HONI\" can be made out.  The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, Sir Gilbert Talbot, or to Henry himself—recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose.\n\nThe traditional subject, Saint George and the Dragon, combining chivalry and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a condottiero, or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another St George in the Louvre, and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London.\n\nProvenance\n\nBy 1627 the painting belonged to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), and was at Wilton House in Wiltshire. Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King Charles I of England.  After the English Civil War it was sold in one of the sales of the Royal Collection at Somerset House in  London on 19 December 1651.  Soon after it was in France. The painting was later a highlight of the Pierre Crozat collection which was acquired through Diderot's mediation by Catherine II of Russia in 1772. For a century and a half, the panel hung in the Imperial Hermitage Museum. It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars. In March 1931 it was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, and bought by Andrew Mellon, as part of his founding donation to the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. This and other foundational artworks, including paintings by Jan van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, and Titian, helped place the National Gallery among the most significant collections of Renaissance art.\nQuestion:\nThe paintings entitled 'St. George and the Dragon' and 'Madonna with the Fish' are works by which Florentine master?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nBonspiel\nA Bonspiel is a curling tournament, consisting of several games, often held on a weekend. Until the 20th century most bonspiels were held outdoors, on a frozen freshwater loch. Today almost all bonspiels are held indoors on specially prepared artificial ice. Though it is not mandatory, curling teams at bonspiels often wear themed costumes.\n\nBonspiels in North America\n\nCanada\n\nBonspiels originated in Scotland, but the most notable competitive curling tournament in the world nowadays is The Brier, the Canadian Men's Curling Championship. For Canadians, this tournament equals or nearly equals the importance of the Olympics and the World Curling Championship. The Canadian Women's Curling Championship tournament is called Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Several Cashspiels are played in Canada every year. The most important cashspiels are part of the World Curling Tour (WCT). Many local curling clubs and other organizations in Canada also host casual, social bonspiels.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States Curling Association (USA Curling) is the national governing body of the sport in the United States. Many bonspiels are listed on [http://www.usacurl.org/ the USA Curling website].  Most bonspiels in the United States are held indoors in dedicated curling facilities. Bonspiels are popular throughout the United States during curling season, typically October through April. Some special bonspiels are held in the summer as well as some that are hosted by clubs that play on arena ice as there are usually fewer scheduling conflicts with other sports at the area such as hockey and figure skating.\n\nBonspiels in Europe\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scotland, outdoor bonspiels are now very rare; most lochs that formerly hosted bonspiels, such as Loch Earn, rarely freeze over anymore. The word spiel is sometimes used to refer to an informal curling game, as in parish spiel. The most important Cashspiels in Scotland are part of the Curling Champions Tour (CCT), previously known as the World Curling Tour Europe (WCT-E).\n\nOther European countries\n\nDozens of bonspiels are held in European countries every year. Switzerland hosts multiple Curling Champions Tour events.\n\nBonspiels elsewhere\n\nNew Zealand\n\nCurling bonspiels are held when ice conditions permit in the Maniototo, part of Central Otago in the South Island. The region is one of the few in New Zealand to have conditions suitable for outdoor curling, and is also a fitting site for the sport given that Otago's original European settlers were mainly from Scotland. Several artificial and natural lakes around the towns of Oturehua, Naseby and Patearoa provide good conditions, on average every second or third year.\n\nThe national bonspiel has been held when conditions permit since 1879, with Oturehua's Idaburn Dam the venue since 1932.  The most recent national bonspiel, the 65th, was held on 9–10 July 2012.  Owing to the difficulty of getting teams to the relatively inaccessible venue, it is rare for teams to travel from outside the southern South Island to the bonspiel.\n\nIndoor curling rinks exist in Otago's main centre, Dunedin (at the Dunedin Ice Stadium), and in the towns of Naseby, Otago and Gore, Southland, and also further north in the country's largest city, Auckland. Open air ice rinks exist in Naseby and Alexandra. \n\nList of Notable Bonspiels\n\n* The largest outdoor bonspiel in the world, the \"[http://www.ironmancurling.com Ironman Outdoor Curling Bonspiel]\" held on the Assiniboine River in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, has been held at The Forks Historic Port every February since 2002. In 2015 there were 72 teams competing.\n* One of the longest-running outdoor bonspiels in the world, the Bonspiel on the Lake in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, has been held on Lake Windermere every January since 1982.  Each year 64 teams compete.\n* The Bonspiel or the Grand Match, between the north and the south of Scotland, is held on a frozen loch (most recently the Lake of Menteith, Stirling) when the winter is cold enough. It was last held in 1979.\n* The Crush Bonspiel in Placer Valley, California, is notorious for its unique combination of curling tournament play and wine festival.  This tournament originated in Vacaville in 2006 but was moved to Roseville  in 2012 because of its rising popularity in surrounding areas.\n* The Brier (Men's Senior Championship of the Canadian Curling Association) is regarded by most curlers as the world's premier curling championship\n* The Tournament of Hearts (Canadian Ladies Curling Association Championship)\n* The Men's World Curling Championship (Scotch Cup/Silver Broom) WCF WCC\n* The Women's World Curling Championship WCC\n* The World Junior Curling Championship (WJCC) WCF\n* The Winter Olympics\n\nOrigin of the word \"Bonspiel\"\n\nThe origin of the word is primarily Gaelic.\n\nSince curling is believed to have originated in Scotland, it is likely that \"bonspiel\" is a modern adaptation of the Scottish Gaelic words \"bonn\" (coin)  and \"spéil\" (skate)  meaning \"coin skate\" or \"cornerstone skate\" (archaic definition). \n\n\"Spiel\" may also have been a Germanic borrowing, meaning \"game\". In that case, the word may have meant \"cornerstone game\".\nQuestion:\nIf you had two eight enders in one bonspiel what are you playing\nAnswer:\n",

But we are at liberty to disclose that Graham Greene called it the \"finest spy story ever written,\" and that the taut tale concerns Alec Leamas, a British agent in early Cold War Berlin. Leamas is responsible for keeping the double agents under his care undercover and alive, but East Germans start killing them, so he gets called back to London by Control, his spy master. Yet instead of giving Leamas the boot, Control gives him a scary assignment: play the part of a disgraced agent, a sodden failure everybody whispers about. Control sends him back out into the cold--deep into Communist territory to checkmate the bad-guy spies on the other side. The political chessboard is black and white, but in human terms the vicinity of the Berlin Wall is a moral no-man's land, a gray abyss patrolled by pawns.\nLe Carré beats most spy writers for two reasons. First, he knows what he's talking about, since he raced around working for British Intelligence while the Wall went up. He's familiar with spycraft's fascinations, but also with the fact that it leaves ideals shaken and emotions stirred. Second, his literary tone has deep autobiographical roots. Spying is about betrayal, and Le Carré was abandoned by his mother and betrayed by his father, a notorious con man. (They figure heavily in his novels Single & Single and A Perfect Spy .) In a world of lies, Le Carré writes the bitter truth: it's every man for himself. And may the best mask win. --Tim Appelo --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the 1963 novel ‘The Spy Who Came in From the Cold’?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nDonald's Nephews\nDonald's Nephews (1938) is a Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.  Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald's Nephews by almost six months. \n\nPlot\n\nDonald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.\n\nDonald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training, and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads \"After all, little children are only angels without wings\". This so enrages Donald that he rips the book to pieces and explodes.\n\nNephews Antics\n\nThroughout the cartoon, Huey, Dewey, and Louie play tricks on their Uncle Donald in order to annoy him. They cause extensive damage throughout his house, and have fun at Donald's expense. Some of their activities include:\n* Playing croquet on tricycles in Donald's living room, breaking vases, lamps, and windows\n* As Donald plays the piano to try to calm his nephews, the boys pick up instruments to play along with him, however Dewey uses his trombone to launch an apple at Donald, and Huey uses his cello to project his bow at Donald\n* While Donald plays the piano, Huey fills a bag with water, and Louie bursts it with his slingshot\n* Giving Donald a pie full of scorching hot mustard, then, to cool him down, they throw water on him and spray him in the face with a fire extinguisher, then throw his book at him and ride away on their tricycles\n\nAvailability\n\n* Walt Disney's Funny Factory With Huey Dewey & Louie Vol. 4\nQuestion:\nWhat are the names of Donald Duck's three nephews?\nAnswer:\n",

Born on a farm at Ettrick, he had ambitions to be a writer from an early age and came to believe that he might emulate Burns. He was still working as a shepherd when his first, unsuccessful, volume of poems appeared in 1801. The following year he met Scott who would champion him over many years.\nImage Rights Holder:\n205:The National Galleries of Scotland, Phase 1\nMaterial:\nPainting: James Hogg, 1770 - 1835. Poet; 'The Ettrick Shepherd'\nSubject:\nHe contributed to Blackwood's Magazine over many years and was himself portrayed there as 'the Ettrick Shepherd' in John Wilson's hilarious sketches, 'Noctes Ambrosianae'. Watson Gordon's portrait, which hints at both poet and shepherd, was painted in 1830 to hang in Blackwood's salon. Hogg's last work of note was Domestic Manners and Private Life of Sir Walter Scott which was published two years after Scott's death - to the annoyance of Scott's biographer, Lockhart - and shortly before Hogg's own death. He was buried in Ettrick churchyard.\nWho:\nJames Hogg, 1770 - 1835, the Ettrick Shepherd (sitter)\nSir John Watson Gordon (maker)\nWhen:\nScottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh\nBackground:\nHe contributed to Blackwood's Magazine over many years and was himself portrayed there as 'the Ettrick Shepherd' in John Wilson's hilarious sketches, 'Noctes Ambrosianae'.

He was buried in Ettrick churchyard.\nDescription:\nHogg's appearance on the literary scene was established by The Queen's Wake which came out in 1813. Many times reprinted, it contains his most quoted piece of verse, 'Kilmeny'. Thereafter his work ranged from the brilliant parodies of contemporary poets in The Poetic Mirror to the works in prose: The Brownie of Bodsbeck, The Three Perils of Man, and, most remarkable of all, The Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, which introduced the theme of the evil doppelganger into Scottish literature.\nAll Rights Burns Scotland\nQuestion:\nWhich poet (1770-1835) was known as the Ettrick Shepherd?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nElvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo - Memphis Guide and ...\nElvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo\nElvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo\nElvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo\nLance Wiedower\nBy Lance Wiedower\nUpdated August 29, 2016.\nElvis Presley fans, rock 'n' roll historians and music lovers of all types know Memphis as the cradle of the sound and home of the king. But the creation of rock 'n' roll and Elvis as king had its origins long before he walked into Sun Studio in Memphis to create the magic. \nThe Elvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi is where it all literally began, and much of the roots of Elvis Presley's exposure to gospel, blues and performance all came together in East Tupelo.\nThe northeastern Mississippi city isn't far from Memphis; in fact, many international visitors to Memphis combine visits to Memphis with Tupelo and some of the blues sites across the northern part of the state. It takes about an hour and a half to drive from Graceland in Memphis to Tupelo, so it's easily done as a day trip.\nThe Elvis birthplace in Tupelo provides a more intimate look at Elvis Aaron Presley, who was born in a tiny house in East Tupelo on Jan. 8, 1935. Elvis, along with his parents Vernon and Gladys, moved to Memphis in 1948 when he was 13.\ncontinue reading below our video\nBest Road Trip Apps\nThe family lived in different locations in Tupelo, but the birthplace is the actual home where Elvis was born, just a few minutes after his twin brother, Jessie, was stillborn.\nThe city bought the house and surrounding property in 1957 when Elvis made his first return back in Tupelo to perform. He donated the proceeds from the concert to purchase the birthplace so that the property could be turned into a public park for the children of East Tupelo who didn't have such facilities.\nTouring the property can take as little as a few minutes or a couple of hours, depending on what is of interest. The Elvis Presley Birthplace Park consists of the birthplace, museum, chapel, gift shop, \"Elvis at 13\" statue, Fountain of Life, Walk of Life, \"Memphis Bound\" car feature, Story Wall and the Assembly of God Church.\nAfter purchasing tickets, visitors tour the grounds on their own and can choose which attraction to visit first. The recommended path is to walk west to the Walk of Life, a scored concrete circle surrounding the birthplace house with a dated granite block denoting every year of Elvis' life. The first 13 years are commemorated with important facts of each year of his time in Tupelo.\nNext to the Mississippi historic site marker for the birthplace is the modest two-room house that was built by Elvis' father, Vernon, with help from his father, Jessie, and brother, Vester. The home is open for tours, and a guide is in the house describing the features of the home and stories of Elvis and his family in Tupelo.\nAfter exiting the home, find the 1948 granite block that points to the Elvis at 13 statue, a life-size replica of what Elvis would have looked like at that age. The sculptor worked from photographs in the property's museum to determine Elvis' facial features, hairline and general body size. The statue was unveiled in August 2002.\nWalk past Mississippi music markers denoting Elvis' contributions to and influences by country and blues music, and find the family's childhood church. The actual building where Elvis was exposed to Southern gospel music was moved to the property from its original location nearby and completely restored. A video plays in the church, giving a feel for what church services were like for Elvis.\nOther nearby sites include the Elvis Presley Memorial Chapel, which was a dream of Elvis' and was dedicated in 1979. A story wall features stories from some of Elvis' childhood friends.\nWalking past the Fountain of Life, enter the Elvis Presley Museum, which was originally opened in 1992 and renovated in 2006. It features the large personal collection of Janelle McComb, a Tupelo resident and long-time friend of the Presley family. It also exhibits Tupelo artifacts. The building also features a large gift shop and event center, that regularly shows a movie on Elvis' life in Tupelo.\nOutside the building pointing northwest toward Memphis is a green 1939 Plymouth sedan, a replica of the car the Presley family drove when leaving Tupelo for Memphis.\nThe birthplace is open Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets can be purchased for the house only, but if time permits it is worth it to buy the full grounds tour.\nQuestion:\nIn what year did Elvis Presley and his parents move from Tupelo to Memphis?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nShark (TV series)\nShark is an American legal drama created by Ian Biederman that originally aired on CBS from September 21, 2006 to May 20, 2008. The series stars James Woods.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe show revolves around Sebastian Stark (Woods), a notorious Los Angeles defense attorney who becomes disillusioned with his career after his successful defense of a wife-abuser results in the wife's death; after more than a month trying to come to grips with his situation, he is invited by the Los Angeles district attorney to become a public prosecutor so he can apply his unorthodox-but-effective talents to putting guilty people away instead of putting them back on the street. Stark's relationship with the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, his staff, and his daughter, forms the central plot for the series.\n\nCast members\n\nCharacters\n\n* Sebastian Stark: A confident and stern former high end defense attorney. Stark was recruited to the DA's office by the mayor after a client he had previously defended against assault charges killed his (the client's) wife just a few days later. Despite his realization after this case, his methods as a defense attorney have not been changed dramatically in his role as a prosecutor.\n* Jessica Devlin: Los Angeles District Attorney for 14 years, Devlin was Stark's boss for the duration of the season one. When she was defeated in an election, however, Stark hired her as the Senior Member of his team.\n* Leo Cutler: Los Angeles District Attorney second season.\n* Madeline Poe: Poe was the only voluntary member of Stark's original team. She had the highest conviction rate of the entire DA's office in the last two years prior to the show's start, and arguably the best lawyer of Stark's original team.\n* Casey Woodland: A young, handsome lawyer from an influential family, Casey finds himself having to prove his worth to those who think he bought his way into the job. He begins a sexual relationship with Madeline Poe in spite of their disdain for each other.\n* Raina Troy: Troy is passionate, smart and tough, and described by Stark as \"brilliant\" but \"a contempt citation waiting to happen.\" Midway through the first season she begins a relationship with Isaac Wright.\n* Danny Reyes: Reyes was transferred from the gang-crime unit, and used past experience to influence his motives. He often conflicts with Stark and Jessica, both of whom privately agree that he is a very good lawyer.\n* Isaac Wright: A former LAPD officer, Stark offered him a job on his team after Wright resigned from LAPD because he planted evidence in the home of a suspect in an effort to arrest his partner's killer.\n* Julie Stark: The daughter of Sebastian, she decided to stay with her father after her custody hearing, because \"he needs her more than he'll ever know.\"\n* Wayne Callison: A serial killer, creative writing teacher and Stark's personal nemesis throughout season 1. He targeted emotionally damaged women in their 20s and tortured them to death by cutting them. After he is acquitted, Stark becomes obsessed with putting him behind bars.\n\nShark's rules\n\n*Trial is War. Second place is death.\n*Truth is relative. Pick one that works.\n*In a jury trial, there are only 12 opinions that matter and yours (speaking to his team) is not one of them.\n\nEpisodes\n\nBroadcast history\n\nThe show first aired in the 10:00 p.m., Eastern Thursday night slot. On October 20, 2006, it was announced that CBS had picked up the show for a full 22-episode season. \nCBS announced on May 16, 2007 that Shark would return for a second season. \n\nIn Shark's second season, it moved to Sunday night at 10:00 p.m., switching timeslots with Without a Trace and thereby competing against another highly rated series, ABC's Brothers & Sisters. In Canada, Global had also picked up Brothers & Sisters, so they decided to keep Shark on Thursday 10 p.m. timeslot, three days ahead of the CBS broadcast (except for the Season 2 premiere), and Brothers & Sisters for their Sunday night 10 p.m. timeslot.\n\nThe show returned Tuesday April 29, 2008 in a new timeslot at 9:00 p.m. to air the four remaining post-strike episodes.

The song was inspired by Native American and First Nation peoples, as well as Kay's anger towards the shooting of elephants. The track addresses various issues such as racism and corporate greed. After recording the song, Kay had a disagreement with his producer who made changes to the lyrics based on popular trends. This experience made Kay realize that he wanted a live band with a live sound. As a result, he named the band \"Jamiroquai\", combining the words \"jam\" and the Iroquois, a Native American confederacy.",

    "input": "Passage:\nBirdman of Alcatraz (film)\nBirdman of Alcatraz is a 1962 film starring Burt Lancaster and directed by John Frankenheimer.   It is a largely fictionalized version of the life of Robert Stroud, a federal prison inmate known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" because of his life with birds. In spite of the title, much of the action is set at Leavenworth Prison, where Stroud was jailed with his birds. When moved to Alcatraz he was not allowed to keep any pets. \n\nThe film was adapted by Guy Trosper from the 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Burt Lancaster), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Telly Savalas), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter) and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White. \n\nPlot\n\nRobert Stroud (Lancaster) is imprisoned as a young man for committing a murder in Alaska. He is shown as a rebellious inmate, fighting against a rigid prison system: on his way to jail by train he breaks open the window to allow the suffocating inmates to breathe. His rebellious attitude puts him in conflict with Harvey Shoemaker (Malden), the warden of Leavenworth Prison.\n\nWhile in jail, Stroud learns that his mother (Ritter) tried to visit him but was denied and told to return later in the week. Outraged, he attacks a guard over the issue and the man is killed. Stroud is sentenced to death, but his mother runs a successful campaign and it is commuted to life in prison. The terms of the sentence require that he be kept in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.\n\nTo break the monotony, Stroud adopts an orphaned baby sparrow as a pet. This starts a trend and he and the other convicts acquire birds, such as canaries, as gifts from the outside. Before long, Stroud has built up a collection of birds and cages. When they fall ill, he conducts experiments and comes up with a cure. As the years pass, Stroud becomes an expert on bird diseases and even publishes a book on the subject. His writings are so impressive that a doctor describes him as a \"genius\".\n\nStroud later meets bird-lover Stella Johnson (Field) and agrees to go into business, marketing his bird remedies. He and Stella later marry, but his mother disapproves and this causes a rift between mother and son. He is abruptly transferred to the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz (the \"Rock\"), a new maximum security institution where he is not permitted to keep birds. He is now growing elderly but still shows a rebellious side, writing a history of the U.S. penal system that is suppressed by Shoemaker, now warden of the Rock.\n\nStill at odds with authority, Stroud nevertheless manages to help stop a prison rebellion in 1946 by throwing out the guns acquired by the convicts. He then assures the authorities that they can now re-enter the premises without fear of being shot. Although Stroud has been a thorn in his side for decades, Shoemaker acknowledges that he has never lied to him and takes him at his word.\n\nAlthough constantly denied parole, Stroud is eventually transferred to another prison in Missouri after a petition campaign. During the move, he meets several reporters and displays a range of knowledge on more than just birds, such as the technical details of a passing jet aircraft. He even gets to meet Thomas E. Gaddis (Edmond O'Brien), the author of the book based on his life.\n\nCast\n\n* Burt Lancaster as Robert Stroud\n* Karl Malden as Harvey Shoemaker\n* Thelma Ritter as Elizabeth McCartney Stroud\n* Neville Brand as Bull Ransom\n* Betty Field as Stella Johnson\n* Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez\n* Edmond O'Brien as Thomas E. Gaddis\n* Hugh Marlowe as Albert Comstock\n* Whit Bissell as Dr. Ellis\n* Crahan Denton as Kramer\n* James Westerfield as Jess Younger\n\nProduction\n\nThis was to have been the American film debut for British director Charles Crichton until he clashed with Lancaster and was replaced by Frankenheimer.   According to Strother Martin, \"I had a nice role in Birdman of Alcatraz.  They fired the original director, Charles Crichton, and I went out with him.  I was replaced by Leo Penn who was eventually cut out of the picture entirely.\" \n\nReception\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 82% of 17 surveyed critics, both contemporaneous and modern, gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10.   In discussing the film's prison setting, Variety wrote, \"Birdman reverses the formula and brings a new breadth and depth to the form.\"  A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it \"a thoughtful yet powerful portrait that cleaves to the heart and mind despite its omissions\".  According to those who knew him while he was in prison, the mild-mannered characterization of Stroud, as presented in Gaddis' book and the subsequent film, was largely fiction. Former inmate Glenn Williams went so far as to say that Stroud \"was not a sweetheart; he was a vicious killer. I think Burt Lancaster owes us all an apology\".  He and another former convict, Jim Quillan, described the real Stroud as a \"jerk\", \"a guy that liked chaos and turmoil and upheaval... Always at somebody else's expense\". They regarded the film as a \"comedy... an excellent comedy\". The film was placed at #76 on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the 'Birdman of Alcatraz'?\nAnswer:\n",

The company closed its final salary scheme to new members in 2002, but this was not enough to stem rising deficits at the fund due partly to falling share prices and partly to rising long term liabilities and increased longevity.\nAmong the plans to be closed is the Mirror Group fund, which was the victim of former proprietor Robert Maxwell's grab.\nThe scheme has 3,000 active members, and they will now be transferred to a defined-contributions scheme, in which their pension payout is related to the amount they put in, as opposed to a fixed amount related to their salary at the end of their careers. As such, pensions will invariably be less generous than under the previous system.\nPaul Holleran of the National Union of Journalists said: \"The scrapping of the final-salary scheme is the latest in a long line of attacks on staff at Trinity Mirror and serious questions need to be asked and answered about the capability of the senior Trinity\ndirectors.\"\nThe group owns five national newspapers, more than 120 regional titles and over 400 digital products, but has struggled in the face of the recession and a sharp fall in advertising revenues.\nThe Daily Mail's owner Daily Mail and General Trust recently shut its own final salary scheme to new members, and the number of defined benefit schemes throughout the private sector is falling fast.\nThe pair are not the only newspaper groups to be struggling. The Observer – the Sunday newspaper owned by the Guardian Media Group – is set from next week to reduce the number of sections to only four. The Scott Trust, the charity that owns GMG, ruled out shutting the title and replacing it with a Guardian-branded edition.\nIts staff will learn which magazines and sections – and how many full-time staff – will survive this week,\nQuestion:\nWho was the owner of Mirror Group newspapers who misused the pension fund\nAnswer:\n",

The NBC Symphony Orchestra was formed in 1937 expressly for the famed Toscanini, the renowned Italian conductor whose celebrated career included tenures as the music director at Milan's La Scala and New York's Philharmonic Orchestra; although he was already 70 years old at the time he agreed to work at NBC, the years he helmed the orchestra were arguably the most creatively fertile of his life.\nDebuting on Christmas night, 1937, from Studio 8-H at the network's headquarter at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, the NBC Symphony Orchestra comprised a who's who of virtuoso performers, among them viola player William Primrose, violinist Edwin Bachmann and timpanist Karl Glassman; in the years to follow, the ensemble's ranks also included Milton Katims, Samuel Antek, Frank Brieff, Robert La Marchina, Harry Glantz and countless others. Their weekly live performances were justly celebrated by critics and audiences alike, with Toscanini also leading his troops into the studio for a series of well-received recordings. All told, the NBC Symphony Orchestra enjoyed 17 years of success before Toscanini -- age 87 -- finally retired after one last performance on April 4, 1951, bringing a golden era to its close. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi\nHear more of\nQuestion:\nFor which conductor was the NBC Symphony orchestra created in 1937?\nAnswer:\n",

And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\r\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.\r\nNancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?\r\nVic: I do. \r\nPhil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. \r\nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.\r\nPhil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. \r\nVic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!\r\nPhil: So, what else?\r\nVic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\r\nPhil: And does this motivate u to train?\r\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \r\nNancy: What do u think about Tumblr?\r\nPhil: What?\r\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\r\nNancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!\r\nPhil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.\r\nVic: Me neither. \r\nPhil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)\r\nNancy: I have my reasons ;)\nSummary: ",

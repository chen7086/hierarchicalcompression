This report examines HUD’s efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs, (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs, (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for its lead grant and rental assistance programs, and (4) measure and report on the performance of its lead efforts. GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to its grant programs, compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting. GAO also interviewed HUD staff and some grantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) lead grant and rental assistance programs have taken steps to address lead paint hazards, but opportunities exist for improvement. For example, in 2016, HUD began using new tools to monitor how public housing agencies comply with lead paint regulations. However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas: Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD’s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD’s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources. Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD’s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies’ self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD’s oversight of public housing agencies. Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs. Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts. In addition, it has not complied with annual statutory reporting requirements, last reporting as required on its lead efforts in 1997. Without better performance assessment and reporting, HUD cannot fully assess the effectiveness of its lead efforts. GAO makes nine recommendations to HUD including to improve lead grant program and compliance monitoring processes, request authority to amend its lead inspection standard in the voucher program, and take additional steps to report on progress. HUD generally agreed with eight of the recommendations. HUD disagreed that it should request authority to use a specific, stricter inspection standard. GAO revised this recommendation to allow HUD greater flexibility to amend its current inspection standard as indicated by analysis of the benefits and costs."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on Federal Efforts to Address Lead Paint Hazards in Housing**  \n\nThis report examines the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) efforts to mitigate lead paint hazards in federally assisted housing, focusing on its grant programs and rental assistance initiatives. Lead exposure poses severe health risks, particularly to children, causing irreversible cognitive damage. While HUD holds primary responsibility for addressing lead hazards in assisted housing, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets federal lead standards, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) establishes health guidelines, such as the blood lead reference value (5 micrograms per deciliter).  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Grant Programs:** HUD administers two competitive grant programs—the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grants—to remediate hazards in private housing. While HUD aligns grant awards with statutory requirements, it lacks comprehensive documentation and evaluation of its scoring processes, risking inconsistent application reviews. Additionally, HUD has not fully leveraged local data to target high-risk areas effectively.  \n\n2. **Compliance Monitoring:** HUD oversees compliance with lead paint regulations in its Housing Choice Voucher and public housing programs. However, reliance on self-certifications by public housing agencies (PHAs) and gaps in data collection limit HUD’s ability to ensure consistent enforcement. Recent cases of false certifications highlight vulnerabilities in oversight.  \n\n3. **Standards and Inspections:** HUD aligns its health and environmental standards with CDC and EPA guidelines but applies weaker inspection requirements for voucher units (visual assessments) compared to public housing (risk assessments). This disparity leaves children in voucher programs less protected.  \n\n4. **Performance Measurement:** HUD lacks comprehensive performance goals and reporting for its lead safety efforts. Despite statutory requirements, it has not issued an annual report since 1997, limiting transparency and accountability.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \nThe report recommends that HUD:  \n- Improve documentation and evaluation of grant processes.  \n- Strengthen compliance monitoring and enforcement procedures.  \n- Adopt a uniform, stricter inspection standard for voucher units.  \n- Develop performance metrics and fulfill reporting obligations to Congress.  \n\nBy addressing these gaps, HUD can enhance its efforts to protect children from lead exposure and ensure safer housing for low-income families.  \n\n*(Word count: 298)*",

      "Federal agencies use heavy equipment such as cranes and forklifts to carry out their missions, but there is no government-wide data on federal agencies' acquisition or management of this equipment. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of heavy equipment. This report, among other objectives, examines: (1) the number, type, and costs of heavy equipment items that are owned by 20 federal agencies and (2) the heavy equipment that selected agencies recently acquired as well as how they decided whether to purchase or lease this equipment. GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively. The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Departments of the Interior and Defense concurred with these recommendations."

The findings are based on data from 20 CFO Act agencies, with in-depth reviews of the Air Force, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS).  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Acquisition Methods and Definitions**:  \n   - Agencies acquire heavy equipment through purchases or leases (short-term \"rentals\" or long-term leases). Definitions vary: the Air Force considers rentals as leases under 120 days, while FWS and NPS define rentals as leases under a year.  \n   - The General Services Administration (GSA) offers a Short-Term Rental program for heavy equipment, aimed at reducing ownership costs for infrequently used items.  \n\n2. **Inventory and Spending**:  \n   - Twenty agencies reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items as of 2017, with the Department of Defense (DOD) owning 74%. The Department of Agriculture ranked second (6%).  \n   - Agencies spent over $7.4 billion (2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment, though actual spending is higher due to unreported costs for 37,000 items (mostly from the Army).  \n\n3. **Lease-vs.-Purchase Decisions**:  \n   - Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to conduct cost analyses to determine whether leasing or purchasing is more economical. However, the Air Force, FWS, and NPS often failed to document these analyses.  \n   - Reasons included unclear guidance, personnel turnover, and reliance on mission needs (e.g., urgent disaster response). For example, FWS and NPS sometimes purchased equipment due to limited rental availability in remote areas.  \n\n4. **Utilization Management**:  \n   - The Air Force and FWS track utilization (e.g., hours used) to redistribute underused equipment. NPS lacks such guidance but is developing policies to improve data collection.  \n\n### Recommendations:  \n1. **To the Air Force**: Clarify when lease-vs.-purchase analyses must be conducted and documented.  \n2. **To the Department of the Interior**: Provide clearer guidance on lease-vs.-purchase analysis requirements for FWS and NPS.  \n\n### Agency Responses:  \n- DOD and Interior concurred with the recommendations and plan to issue updated guidance.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Without consistent documentation of cost analyses and utilization tracking, agencies risk inefficient spending.

      "Acquisition management has been a long-standing challenge at NASA, although GAO has reported on improvements the agency has made in recent years. Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months. GAO is not making any recommendations in this statement, but has made recommendations in prior reports to strengthen NASA's acquisition management of its major projects. NASA has generally agreed with GAO's recommendations and taken steps to implement them."

This report examines three major telescope projects—**WFIRST**, **TESS**, and **JWST**—highlighting their progress, risks, and broader lessons for managing large-scale acquisitions.  \n\n### **Project Overviews**  \n1. **WFIRST**: A $3.2–$3.8 billion observatory in early development, designed to study the universe’s structure and exoplanets. An independent review found its scope misaligned with resources, requiring design simplifications to stay within budget.  \n2. **TESS**: A $337 million exoplanet surveyor set to launch in March 2018. It faces risks, including SpaceX launch vehicle certification and camera focus issues, and now lacks reserve funding for delays.  \n3. **JWST**: A flagship $8.8 billion telescope with unparalleled sensitivity, now delayed to 2019 due to technical hurdles (e.g., sunshield deployment). Exhausted schedule reserves and rising costs threaten its congressional $8 billion cap.  \n\n### **Key Challenges**  \n- **Integration and Testing**: The riskiest phase, where JWST and other projects encounter unforeseen problems, leading to delays.  \n- **Inadequate Reserves**: JWST’s history of underfunded reserves caused cascading budget overruns, a lesson not fully applied to newer projects like the Space Launch System.  \n- **Unupdated Cost Estimates**: Few NASA projects regularly update Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) analyses, limiting decision-makers’ ability to address emerging risks.  \n- **Contractor Oversight**: Weak oversight contributed to cost overruns (e.g., JWST, Space Network Ground Segment). Strengthened NASA involvement has improved outcomes.  \n\n### **Recommendations**  \n1. **Balance Portfolio Priorities**: Large projects like JWST can drain resources from other missions. NASA must align budgets with scientific priorities.  \n2. **Maintain Reserves**: Adequate cost/schedule reserves are critical to address risks, especially for complex projects.  \n3. **Update JCLs Regularly**: Real-time risk assessments ensure transparency and proactive problem-solving.  \n4. **Enhance Contractor Management**: Increased NASA oversight at contractor facilities mitigates delays and cost growth.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile NASA has made strides in project management, persistent issues in planning, reserves, and oversight threaten mission success. Applying lessons from JWST and adopting GAO’s recommendations could mitigate risks for future projects, ensuring sustainable exploration and scientific discovery.  \n\n**Prepared for:** U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)  \n**Contact:** Cristina T.

      "GAO has designated DHS management as high risk because of challenges in building a cohesive department. PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures. DHS did not concur with a recommendation to apply the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to identify and communicate workforce needs. GAO believes this recommendation is valid as discussed in the report."

Despite this change, the position remained vacant as of June 2018, with a Deputy Under Secretary temporarily performing dual roles. The NDAA codified PLCY’s responsibilities, including leading department-wide policy development, strategic planning, and interagency coordination.

      "Previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the United States have raised questions about the security of the U.S. government's process for adjudicating NIVs, which are issued to foreign nationals, such as tourists, business visitors, and students, seeking temporary admission into the United States. For example, the December 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the United States under a NIV. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks. Further, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants, such as email addresses and social media handles."

NIVs are issued to foreign nationals—such as tourists, students, and temporary workers—seeking temporary entry into the United States.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Adjudication Process:**  \n   - State oversees NIV applications at over 220 overseas posts, with processing times ranging from one day to months. Some visas (e.g., employment-based or fiancé visas) require prior approval from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which conducts background checks using law enforcement databases.  \n   - Applicants may be refused visas for reasons such as inadmissibility (e.g., security risks, prior immigration violations) or ineligibility (e.g., insufficient ties to their home country).  \n\n2. **Trends (2012–2017):**  \n   - **Volume:** NIV adjudications peaked at 13.4 million in FY2016 but dropped by 7% in FY2017, partly due to fewer Chinese applicants after visa validity periods were extended.  \n   - **Refusal Rates:** Increased from 14% (2012) to 22% (2016–2017), with most refusals citing applicants’ potential intent to overstay (90%) or inadequate documentation (5%). Only 0.05% were refused for terrorism-related concerns.  \n   - **Visa Categories:** Tourist/business visas accounted for 80% of adjudications, followed by student/exchange visas (9%) and temporary workers (6%). H-2A agricultural worker visas saw a 140% increase due to demand for lawful labor.  \n\n3. **Policy Changes:**  \n   - **Executive Orders (2017):** Presidential actions (EOs 13769, 13780, and Proclamation 9645) imposed visa restrictions on nationals of certain countries (e.g., Iran, Syria) and mandated enhanced vetting, including social media reviews. These faced legal challenges but were upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.  \n   - **Enhanced Screening:** State introduced Form DS-5535 to collect additional applicant data (e.g., travel history, social media). DHS also established uniform vetting standards for interviews and security checks.  \n\n4. **Regional and Nationality Trends:**  \n   - China, Mexico, and India accounted for 40% of NIV adjudications in 2017.  \n   - Adjudications shifted slightly from Western Hemisphere posts (42% in 2017) to regions like Africa and South/Central Asia.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe NIV process involves multi-agency coordination, with evolving policies aimed at balancing security and facilitation. Refusal rates rose due to stricter scrutiny, while executive actions reshaped eligibility criteria. Ongoing reforms, like the National Vetting Center, aim to standardize screening across immigration programs.  \n\n*(Note: This summary condenses key points; detailed data and legal analysis are in the full report.)*",

      "The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Report**  \n\nThe **Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA)** was enacted to address concerns that federally insured banks were not adequately meeting the credit needs of the local communities where they operated. The CRA mandates that banks serve the convenience and credit needs of their service areas, particularly low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods, while maintaining safe and sound banking practices. Federal regulators assess banks through CRA examinations, evaluating activities such as lending, community investments, and services that benefit LMI areas. Banks receive performance ratings (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance), which influence regulatory approvals for mergers, branches, and other expansions.  \n\n**Key Objectives and Implementation:**  \n- **Redlining Prevention:** The CRA discourages discriminatory lending practices, such as redlining, where banks deny credit to certain neighborhoods or applicants despite their creditworthiness.  \n- **Assessment Areas:** Banks define geographic areas (typically where they have branches or deposit-taking operations) for CRA evaluation. Regulators ensure these areas include LMI communities and do not exclude them arbitrarily.  \n- **Qualifying Activities:** Banks earn CRA credits for mortgage, small business, and consumer lending; investments in community development projects; and low-cost services like financial literacy programs.  \n\n**Debates and Challenges:**  \nCritics argue the CRA may incentivize risky lending or divert banks from more profitable opportunities. However, regulators discourage high-risk loans (e.g., subprime mortgages) and emphasize prudent underwriting. Others contend enforcement is too lenient, as nearly all banks receive Satisfactory or better ratings. The rise of digital banking has also complicated the CRA’s geographic focus, prompting calls for modernization.  \n\n**Recent Reforms and Recommendations:**  \nIn 2018, the U.S. Treasury proposed updates to the CRA, including:  \n1. **Redefining Assessment Areas** to reflect online/mobile banking trends.  \n2. **Clarifying Eligible Activities** to encourage innovation.  \n3. **Streamlining Examinations** to reduce delays.  \n4. **Aligning Incentives** for long-term community investments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe CRA remains a cornerstone of equitable lending policy, but its effectiveness depends on balancing community reinvestment with banks’ financial viability. Ongoing reforms aim to adapt the CRA to modern banking while preserving its mission of expanding credit access in underserved areas.  \n\n*(Word count: ~300; fits one page with standard formatting.)*",

      "Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."

      "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\"). The agency is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC also requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program."

      "The effects of climate change, combined with other factors, may alter human migration trends across the globe, according to the International Organization for Migration. For example, climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, causing populations to move from an area. Climate change can also intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, or sea level rise, potentially altering longer-term migration trends. GAO was asked to review how U.S. agencies address climate change as a potential driver of global migration. For State, USAID, and DOD, this report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the agencies discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes agency activities on the issue. GAO analyzed documents on administration priorities; reviewed agency plans, risk assessments, and documentation of agency activities; and interviewed agency officials. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, a variety of executive branch actions related to climate change—such as executive orders and strategies—affected the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), including their activities that could potentially address the nexus of climate change and migration. For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum—rescinded in 2017—required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order—also rescinded in 2017—requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern. State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration. The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration. For example, USAID officials said that the agency's adaptation efforts, such as its Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion project in Ethiopia, were the most likely to include activities, such as enhancing resilience, that can indirectly address the issue of climate change as a driver of migration. GAO recommends that State provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for climate change risk assessments for country strategies. In commenting on a draft of this report, State indicated that it would update its integrated country strategy guidance and will specifically note that missions have the option to provide additional information on climate resilience and related topics."

      "Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority. DOD concurred with the recommendations."

      "In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, worth a combined total of up to $6.8 billion, to develop crew transportation systems and conduct initial missions to the ISS. In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress. GAO believes these recommendations remain valid, as discussed in the report."

The program has progressed through multiple phases, narrowing participants from initial Space Act agreements to firm-fixed-price contracts with Boeing ($4.2 billion) and SpaceX ($2.6 billion). These contracts cover design, testing, certification, and operational missions, with stringent safety and performance requirements.  \n\n### **Progress and Challenges**  \nBoth contractors have made strides but face delays due to technical hurdles:  \n- **Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner** risks include abort system performance, parachute reliability, and launch vehicle data gaps.  \n- **SpaceX’s Dragon 2** must resolve issues like turbine cracking in its Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and controversial propellant-loading procedures.  \nNASA’s schedule risk analysis predicts further delays, with certification likely slipping to late 2019 or early 2020—beyond the contractors’ optimistic timelines. Without timely certification, a gap in U.S. ISS access could occur after 2019, as Soyuz seats are unavailable beyond 2020. NASA lacks a formal contingency plan to address this risk.  \n\n### **Safety and Certification**  \nNASA’s certification process hinges on a \"loss of crew\" (LOC) metric, targeting a 1 in 270 probability of fatality. However, inconsistent approaches—such as varying debris models and operational mitigations—cloud risk assessments. The program also faces workload challenges in reviewing safety deliverables, including hazard reports and verification data.  \n\n### **Governance Concerns**  \nThe program’s safety oversight is compromised by a dual-hatted structure: the chief safety officer also manages programmatic priorities, creating potential conflicts. This contradicts NASA’s post-Columbia accident reforms advocating independent safety oversight.  \n\n### **Recommendations**  \n1. **Enhance Congressional Reporting**: Include NASA’s schedule risk analysis in quarterly updates to clarify likely delays.  \n2. **Develop Contingency Plans**: Ensure uninterrupted ISS access if delays persist.  \n3. **Clarify Risk Tolerance**: Standardize LOC assessment methods before certification.  \n4. **Capture Lessons Learned**: Document LOC metric challenges for future programs.  \n5. **Restructure Oversight**: Separate safety and programmatic roles to ensure independence.  \n\nNASA concurred with three recommendations but resisted sharing internal schedule analyses with Congress. The report underscores the need for transparency, consistent safety standards, and proactive risk management to safeguard ISS operations and crew safety.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The CCP is critical to restoring U.S. crew launch capabilities, but delays, safety ambiguities, and governance gaps threaten its success. Addressing these issues is vital to maintaining America’s leadership in human spaceflight.  \n\n---  \n*Word count: 498*",

      "The United States is a member of the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, which promote democracy, health care, agricultural development, and scientific exchange. GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. GAO recommends that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. USDA and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations."

      "The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."

      "DOD requested about $60 billion for fiscal years 2009 - 2017 to purchase goods and services overseas and reimburse service-members for costs incurred while stationed abroad. DOD uses foreign currency exchange rates to budget and pay (that is, disburse amounts) for these expenses. It also manages the FCFD account to mitigate a loss in buying power that results from foreign currency rate changes. GAO was asked to examine DOD's processes to budget for and manage foreign currency fluctuations. This report (1) describes DOD's revision of its foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised rates and projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to disburse funds to liquidate O&M obligations, and determined whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account balance. GAO analyzed data on foreign currency rates, DOD financial management regulations, a non-generalizable sample of foreign currency disbursement data, and FCFD account balances. The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency exchange rates (“budget rates”) during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for each of the nine foreign currencies it uses to develop its Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) budget request. These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions. DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure). GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."

These rates, set 18 months before the fiscal year, impact funding requests and potential gains/losses due to exchange rate fluctuations. Historically, DOD used a 5-year weighted average model but adjusted its methodology in 2017 to a 6-month average to better reflect market conditions, avoiding projected $1 billion in gains.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Budget Rate Revisions:** DOD revised rates in FY2014–2016 to align with Treasury rates, reducing projected funding needs by $2.7 billion and minimizing gains/losses. However, rates for FY2009–2013 were not revised, and DOD did not explain why.  \n2. **Disbursement Inefficiencies:** DOD often uses costlier 5-day advanced rates for disbursements instead of more economical 3-day or spot rates. The Army saved $6 million by switching to 3-day rates, but other services have not systematically reviewed rate selections, missing potential savings.  \n3. **FCFD Account Mismanagement:** The Foreign Currency Fluctuation Defense (FCFD) account, capped at $970 million, covers losses from rate fluctuations. DOD replenishes it to the statutory maximum without analyzing projected losses, risking inefficient use of funds. In FY2009–2016, $1.92 billion was transferred to cover losses, but gains were not reinvested.  \n4. **Reporting Deficiencies:** Financial reports on foreign currency transactions are incomplete or inaccurate, hindering oversight. For example, the Army’s system records disbursements to the wrong fiscal year, distorting gain/loss calculations.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Review disbursement rate selections to identify cost-saving opportunities.  \n2. Base FCFD account balances on analyzed projected losses rather than arbitrary caps.  \n3. Improve data accuracy in financial reports by clarifying correction procedures.  \n4. Develop a plan to fix the Army’s disbursement recording system.  \n\nDOD concurred with three recommendations but partially disagreed with analyzing FCFD balances, citing exchange rate volatility. However, better analysis could optimize resource use. Addressing these issues would enhance fiscal accountability and ensure efficient management of overseas expenditures.  \n\n---  \n*Note: This summary condenses a detailed GAO report highlighting inefficiencies in DOD’s foreign currency processes and proposes corrective actions.*",

      "The combination of growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. The use of LNG as an engine (\"bunker\") fuel in shipping is also drawing attention from federal agencies and is beginning to emerge as an issue of interest in Congress. In 2008, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships requires vessels to either use fuels containing less than 0.5% sulfur or install exhaust-cleaning systems (\"scrubbers\") to limit a vessel's airborne emissions of sulfur oxides to an equivalent level. An option for vessel operators to meet the IMO 2020 standards is to install LNG-fueled engines, which emit only trace amounts of sulfur. Adopting LNG engines requires more investment than installing scrubbers, but LNG-fueled engines may offset their capital costs with operating cost advantages over conventional fuels. Savings would depend on the price spread between LNG and fuel oil. Recent trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long run than conventional fuels. LNG bunkering requires specialized infrastructure for supply, storage, and delivery to vessels. To date, the number of ports worldwide that have developed such infrastructure is limited, although growth in this area has accelerated. Early adoption of LNG bunkering is occurring in Europe where the European Union requires a core network of ports to provide LNG bunkering by 2030. LNG bunkering is also advancing in Asia, led by Singapore, the world's largest bunkering port. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, have about 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. LNG bunkering in the United States currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, and Port Fourchon, LA—with a third facility under development in Tacoma, WA. Bunkering of LNG-fueled cruise ships using barges also is planned for Port Canaveral, FL. The relative locations of other U.S. ports and operating LNG terminals suggest that LNG bunkering could be within reach of every port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. On the West Coast, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, are near the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma are adjacent to the proposed Tacoma LNG project. Since 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have taken steps to transition their fleets to use cleaner burning fuels, including LNG. Shippers of dry goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have taken delivery or have ordered LNG-fueled and LNG-capable vessels from U.S. shipyards in Philadelphia, PA, and Brownsville, TX. Another company operates five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels built in Gulfport, MS. Depending upon LNG conversions, the global LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030. If U.S. LNG producers were to supply a significant share of this market—on the strength of comparatively low LNG production costs—LNG bunkering could increase demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. Opportunities in LNG-related shipbuilding might be more limited, as most shipbuilding occurs overseas, although domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges could be one area of economic growth. Finally, engineering and construction firms could benefit from new opportunities to develop port infrastructure for LNG storage and transfer. However, while vessel conversion to LNG fuel may increase demand for U.S.-produced natural gas, it partially could be offset by reduced demand for U.S.-produced crude oil or refined products. Furthermore, while LNG can reduce direct emissions from vessels, fugitive emissions and environmental impacts from natural gas production and transportation could reduce overall emissions benefits. While the LNG industry has experienced few accidents, the Coast Guard has been developing new standards to address unique safety and security risks associated with LNG in vessel operations. The overarching consideration about LNG bunkering in the United States is uncertainty about how the global shipping fleet will adapt to the IMO sulfur standards over time. This uncertainty complicates decisions related to both private investment and public policy. Although Congress has limited ability to influence global shipping, it could influence the growth of LNG bunkering through the tax code and regulation, or through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole. Evaluating the potential implications of LNG bunkering within the context of broader energy and environmental policies may become an additional consideration for Congress. If LNG bunkering expands significantly, Congress also may examine the adequacy of existing measures to ensure the safety and security of LNG vessels, storage, and related facilities."

      "More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."

However, oil markets have transformed significantly since then. Domestic crude production has surged due to shale extraction technologies, while consumption has stabilized, reducing net imports from 12 million barrels per day (2005) to under 4 million (2017). Projections indicate the U.S. will become a net oil exporter by the late 2020s, exempting it from the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 90-day import reserve obligation—though it must still participate in collective actions during global disruptions.  \n\nThe SPR’s infrastructure, primarily crude oil stored in Gulf Coast salt caverns, is aging, with maintenance backlogs risking operational reliability. While the SPR has been used for domestic emergencies (e.g., hurricanes), its crude-only composition limits responsiveness to refined product shortages. Regional reserves (e.g., Northeast heating oil and gasoline reserves) address some vulnerabilities, but studies suggest expanding such reserves to other high-risk areas, like the Southeast and West Coast, could enhance resilience.  \n\nKey challenges include:  \n1. **Uncertain SPR Size**: Congress has mandated sales (290 million barrels since 2015), reducing reserves to ~405 million barrels by 2027. The Department of Energy (DOE) lacks a clear optimal size analysis, overlooking private-sector reserves (194 days of import coverage in 2017) and global market dynamics.  \n2. **Modernization Delays**: A $1.4 billion modernization plan, funded partly by oil sales, lags behind congressional mandates. Excess storage capacity (43% by 2027) may require site closures or leasing options, but DOE has not fully evaluated alternatives like leasing to private industry or allies.  \n3. **Policy Gaps**: Unlike other IEA members, the U.S. does not tie reserve targets to net imports or consumption, risking inefficiency.  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n- Congress should set a long-term SPR size target based on projected production, consumption, and IEA obligations.  \n- DOE should:  \n  1. Reassess the SPR’s optimal size, incorporating private-sector responses and cost-benefit analyses.  \n  2. Conduct periodic strategic reviews to adapt to market changes.  \n  3. Study regional product reserves for vulnerable areas.  \n  4. Explore options (e.g., leasing, sales) for excess SPR assets.  \n\nDOE agreed to some recommendations but opposed regional reserve studies, citing inefficiency—despite evidence of their economic benefits.

      "Full implementation of GPRAMA could facilitate efforts to reform the federal government and make it more effective. GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates. OMB staff agreed with these recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on GPRAMA Implementation and Governance Challenges**  \n\nThe Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA), enacted in 2010, enhances the federal government’s performance management framework by promoting accountability, cross-agency collaboration, and data-driven decision-making. This report evaluates GPRAMA’s implementation, focusing on four key governance challenges: addressing crosscutting issues, improving the use of performance information, aligning operations with results, and enhancing transparency.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Crosscutting Issues**: GPRAMA’s Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) and Agency Priority Goals (APG) have improved collaboration, but challenges remain in managing fragmentation and duplication. While progress has been made, 54% of identified actions to reduce overlap remain unresolved.  \n2. **Performance Information Use**: Federal managers report stagnant or declining use of performance data in decision-making since 1997. Despite GPRAMA’s requirements, agencies struggle with leadership commitment, communication, and data quality.  \n3. **Alignment with Results**: Agencies have not fully linked individual performance to organizational goals. Strategic and data-driven reviews show promise but are underutilized beyond priority goals.  \n4. **Transparency and Openness**: Public access to performance data remains limited. Performance.gov and the DATA Act aim to improve transparency, but delays in implementing program inventories and inconsistent reporting hinder progress.  \n\n### Recommendations:  \n- **OMB** should resume CAP and APG reporting, finalize program inventory guidance, and expand data-driven reviews to more goals.  \n- **Agencies** should strengthen leadership accountability, improve performance data quality, and enhance public communication.  \n\nWhile GPRAMA has advanced performance management, persistent challenges highlight the need for stronger implementation to achieve meaningful results. Continued oversight and adherence to best practices are essential for addressing long-standing governance gaps.  \n\n**Conclusion**: GPRAMA provides critical tools for improving federal performance, but full implementation and cultural shifts are necessary to maximize its impact.",

      "Concerns over efforts by U.S. taxpayers to use offshore accounts to hide income or evade taxes contributed to the passage of FATCA in 2010, which sought to create greater transparency and accountability over offshore assets held by U.S. taxpayers. House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad. State and Social Security Administration agreed with GAO's recommendations. Treasury and IRS neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on FATCA Implementation and Challenges**  \n\nThe **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)** was enacted to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding offshore assets. It requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report detailed information about U.S. customers to the IRS annually. Additionally, certain taxpayers must disclose foreign financial assets exceeding specified thresholds via **Form 8938**. While FATCA enhances transparency, the report identifies several challenges in its implementation and broader impacts.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **IRS Compliance Challenges:**  \n   - **Inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs):** Nearly half of FFI-submitted Forms 8966 lack valid TINs, hindering the IRS’s ability to match accounts to taxpayers.  \n   - **Data Management Issues:** IRS databases (e.g., IRTF, MTRDB) inconsistently store Form 8938 data, limiting enforcement effectiveness.  \n   - **Lack of Strategic Plan:** The IRS abandoned its 2016 FATCA Compliance Roadmap, relying instead on ad hoc campaigns, reducing oversight and coordination.  \n\n2. **Unnecessary Filings:**  \n   - Over **73,500 Forms 8938** filed in 2016 reported assets below thresholds, likely due to taxpayer confusion about requirements.  \n\n3. **Overlap with FBAR Reporting:**  \n   - **75% of Form 8938 filers** also submitted FBARs, creating duplication. Both forms collect similar data but serve different purposes (tax compliance vs. anti-money laundering).  \n   - Harmonizing statutes could reduce redundancy and taxpayer burden.  \n\n4. **FATCA vs. Common Reporting Standard (CRS):**  \n   - FATCA and CRS share similarities but differ in scope (e.g., FATCA targets U.S. persons; CRS focuses on tax residency).  \n   - Full CRS adoption by the U.S. would require legislative changes but could streamline global reporting.  \n\n5. **Impacts on U.S. Persons Abroad:**  \n   - **Financial Access Barriers:** Some FFIs deny services to U.S. persons due to FATCA compliance costs.  \n   - **Employment Challenges:** Foreign firms avoid hiring U.S. persons to prevent reporting burdens.  \n   - **SSN Obstacles:** Americans abroad face delays obtaining Social Security Numbers, complicating tax compliance.  \n   - **Renunciations:** Citizenship renunciations rose **178% (2011–2016)**, partly linked to FATCA-related burdens.  \n\n### **Recommendations:**  \n- **Congress:** Amend statutes to align FATCA and FBAR reporting, reducing overlap.  \n- **IRS:**  \n  - Develop a risk-mitigation plan for TIN inaccuracies.  \n  - Improve data accessibility and clarity for compliance units.  \n  - Re-establish a comprehensive FATCA enforcement strategy.  \n  - Clarify filing rules to reduce unnecessary submissions.  \n- **Treasury, State, and SSA:** Collaborate formally to address FATCA’s unintended consequences for expatriates.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nFATCA has improved offshore tax transparency but faces operational and coordination challenges. Addressing data quality, redundancy, and taxpayer burdens—while ensuring interagency collaboration—is critical to achieving FATCA’s goals without undue hardship on U.S. persons abroad.  \n\n*(Word count: ~500; fits one page when formatted concisely.)*",

      "In February 2017, components of California's Oroville Dam failed, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 nearby residents. FERC is the federal regulator of the Oroville Dam and over 2,500 other dams associated with nonfederal hydropower projects nationwide. FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams. FERC agreed with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on U.S. Dam Safety and Hydropower Oversight**  \n\nThe report examines the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) oversight of dam safety for hydropower projects in the United States. As of 2016, there are approximately 90,500 dams in the U.S., with about 2,100 (2.5%) supporting hydropower. These projects, operated by federal and non-federal entities, contribute 8% of the nation’s electric capacity. FERC regulates around 1,000 non-federal hydropower projects (comprising over 2,500 dams) under the Federal Power Act, ensuring safety through licensing, inspections, and enforcement.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Dam Safety Inspections:** FERC employs a multi-layered approach, including regular inspections by staff and independent consultants, hazard classifications (low, significant, high), and required engineering studies. However, inconsistent recording of inspection data across regional offices limits FERC’s ability to analyze trends or common deficiencies nationwide.  \n2. **Engineering Studies:** Licensees must conduct studies (e.g., hydrology, seismicity, stability) to assess dam performance, reviewed by FERC using flexible guidelines that allow for professional judgment. While studies are generally robust, some rely on outdated data, and gaps exist where original design documents are missing.  \n3. **Relicensing Process:** FERC evaluates safety during relicensing but focuses more on high-hazard dams. Third-party input on safety is rare, and FERC has never denied a license due to safety concerns, preferring to enforce compliance through license conditions.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- **Standardize Data Recording:** FERC should establish uniform procedures for documenting inspection findings to enable cross-portfolio analysis.  \n- **Proactive Risk Analysis:** FERC should use inspection data to identify and prioritize systemic safety risks, similar to its response to the 2017 Oroville Dam spillway failure.  \n\n**Conclusion:** While FERC’s oversight framework is comprehensive, gaps in data consistency and risk assessment hinder its ability to proactively address emerging safety issues. Implementing the recommendations would strengthen FERC’s capacity to safeguard dam infrastructure and public safety.  \n\n*(Word count: 298)*",

      "Regulation of the banking industry has undergone substantial changes over the past decade. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following: Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate. Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question. Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue. Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline. What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Government Report on Banking Regulation and Industry Trends**  \n\nBanks play a critical role in the U.S. economy by facilitating credit allocation and connecting savers with borrowers. However, banking is inherently risky, and failures can have devastating economic consequences. The regulatory framework has evolved to balance these risks with the benefits of banking, particularly after the 2007–2009 financial crisis, which exposed weaknesses in oversight. In response, Congress passed the **Dodd-Frank Act (2010)** to strengthen financial regulation, followed by the **Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act, 2018)**, which eased certain rules for smaller banks.  \n\n### **Key Regulatory Issues**  \n1. **Prudential Regulation**:  \n   - **Capital Requirements**: Banks must maintain capital buffers to absorb losses. Debate persists over risk-weighted vs. leverage ratios, with critics arguing complexity favors large banks. The EGRRCP Act introduced a simplified **Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR)** for small banks.  \n   - **Volcker Rule**: Prohibits proprietary trading to reduce risk but faces criticism for compliance burdens. The EGRRCP Act exempted smaller banks, and regulators proposed simplifying the rule.  \n\n2. **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Cybersecurity**:  \n   - AML rules require banks to report suspicious activity, but compliance costs are contentious. Recent reforms focus on **beneficial ownership transparency**.  \n   - Cybersecurity threats (e.g., data breaches) highlight the need for robust protections, though overlapping regulations raise efficiency concerns.  \n\n3. **Consumer Protection**:  \n   - The **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** enforces fair lending and transparency rules. Critics argue regulations like the **Ability-to-Repay mortgage rule** increase costs and reduce credit access.  \n\n### **Industry Trends & Challenges**  \n- **Decline of Community Banks**: Mergers, regulatory burdens, and competition have reduced small banks’ numbers. The EGRRCP Act aimed to ease their regulatory load.  \n- **Too Big to Fail (TBTF)**: Large banks remain under enhanced scrutiny, but the EGRRCP Act raised the threshold for stricter oversight from $50 billion to $100 billion in assets.  \n- **Fintech & Shadow Banking**:  \n  - **Fintech innovations** (e.g., digital lending) offer efficiency but pose regulatory challenges. The OCC proposed a **special-purpose fintech charter**, contested by state regulators.  \n  - **Shadow banking** (nonbank lending) lacks safeguards, raising systemic risk concerns post-crisis.  \n- **Interest Rate Risks**: After years of low rates, Fed normalization efforts could pressure banks’ profitability, particularly if net interest margins shrink.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe banking sector continues to adapt to regulatory changes, technological disruption, and economic shifts. Policymakers face ongoing debates over how to balance financial stability, consumer protection, and industry competitiveness. Future focus areas include refining capital rules, addressing fintech integration, and mitigating risks from rising interest rates and shadow banking.",

      "In addition to more than 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, DOD employs about 760,000 federal civilians and more than 560,000 contractors. In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel. GAO believes the assessment is correct as discussed in the report."

The DOD’s workforce management is governed by statutes (10 U.S.C. §§ 129, 129a, 2463) and policies (DOD Instruction 1100.22) that emphasize cost-efficiency and appropriate workforce mix decisions.  \n\nIn response to a congressional mandate, the DOD conducted a study comparing the fully burdened costs of civilian and contractor personnel performing similar functions at selected installations. The study assessed performance, accounted for costs, and compared expenses across roles like administrative staff, mid-level managers, and leadership. Key findings include:  \n\n1. **Cost Comparisons**: The DOD developed a methodology to compare labor costs for civilians and contractors at nine locations, including two outside the continental U.S. However, it excluded non-labor costs (e.g., facility overhead, contract management), which are required for a full cost accounting under DOD guidelines. While the DOD argued these exclusions were justified for common costs, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that imbalances in workforce ratios at some sites necessitated their inclusion.  \n\n2. **Results**: The DOD concluded that neither civilians nor contractors were consistently more cost-effective; expenses varied by function, location, and expertise. However, GAO noted that incomplete cost data limited the study’s accuracy and generalizability.  \n\n3. **Hiring Authorities**: The DOD evaluated flexible hiring options, finding inconsistent use across agencies and a need for streamlined processes. It recommended collaborating with the Office of Personnel Management to refine hiring authorities.  \n\nThe GAO determined the DOD only partially met the mandate by failing to fully account for all costs, as required by 10 U.S.C. § 2463 and DOD policies. The GAO reiterated prior recommendations for improved cost methodologies and data accuracy. The DOD disagreed, asserting it complied with congressional intent by accounting for—though not calculating—non-labor costs.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While the DOD’s study provided insights into workforce costs, its exclusion of key expenses hindered a comprehensive comparison. The GAO urges the DOD to adopt complete cost analyses and improve workforce data to inform future decisions.  \n\n---  \n*Key References*: DOD Instruction 7041.04, GAO-17-128, 10 U.S.C. §§ 129, 129a, 2463.",

The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings in each of these action areas, including protecting cyber critical infrastructure, managing the cybersecurity workforce, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Although many recommendations have been addressed, about 1,000 have not yet been implemented. Until these shortcomings are addressed, federal agencies' information and systems will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies since 2010 aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings. As of August 2018, about 1,000 still needed to be implemented."

      "Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on the Decline of Cash and the Rise of Electronic Payments**  \n\nThis report examines the growing shift from cash to electronic payment systems, driven by technological advancements, cost efficiency, and consumer preference. While cash remains widely used in the U.S., electronic payment methods—including credit/debit cards, mobile apps (e.g., Venmo), and cryptocurrencies—are becoming dominant due to their convenience and lower costs. Some businesses, even those handling small transactions, are increasingly refusing cash, mirroring trends in countries like Sweden. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are exploring government-backed digital currencies (CBDCs), signaling a potential future where cash plays a diminished role.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n\n1. **Electronic Payment Growth**: Traditional systems (cards, ACH) and newer alternatives (cryptocurrencies) are expanding rapidly. In 2015, noncash transactions in the U.S. totaled 144 billion, while cash use declined from 40.7% of transactions in 2012 to 31% in 2016.  \n\n2. **Advantages of Cash**: Cash is simple, universally accepted, and resilient during technological disruptions. It also ensures privacy and serves as a safe asset during financial instability.  \n\n3. **Costs of Cash**: Handling cash involves expenses like ATM fees, security, and theft risks. Businesses lose an estimated $40 billion annually to employee theft, while consumers face fees and inconvenience.  \n\n4. **Government Impact**: Cash generates revenue via seigniorage (profit from printing currency) and Fed remittances but enables tax evasion, costing the U.S. an estimated $387 billion annually in unreported income.  \n\n5. **Cryptocurrencies and CBDCs**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer decentralization and privacy but face volatility, scalability issues, and regulatory concerns. CBDCs, though not yet implemented, could improve payment efficiency but may disrupt traditional banking.  \n\n### **Potential Outcomes of a Cashless Society:**  \n\n- **Benefits**:  \n  - Increased payment efficiency and reduced costs for businesses.  \n  - Lower crime rates (e.g., theft, tax evasion) due to traceable transactions.  \n  - Enhanced monetary policy flexibility, including the feasibility of negative interest rates.  \n\n- **Risks**:  \n  - Marginalization of unbanked populations (9 million U.S. households lack bank accounts).  \n  - Vulnerability to cyberattacks and system failures without a physical backup.  \n  - Loss of financial privacy and anonymity.  \n\n### **International Case Studies**:  \n- **Sweden**: Cash usage dropped from 40% to 13% of transactions (2010–2018), driven by tech-savvy consumers and digital payment innovations. However, elderly and unbanked groups face challenges.  \n- **Kenya**: Mobile money (e.g., M-Pesa) expanded financial access but hasn’t fully replaced cash, which remains preferred for small transactions.  \n\n### **Policy Considerations**:  \nCongress may need to address the decline of cash, balancing efficiency gains against risks like financial exclusion and cybersecurity. Potential interventions include ensuring access to low-cost banking services or regulating digital payment systems to protect consumers.  \n\nThe report concludes that while cash’s role is diminishing, its complete disappearance is unlikely in the near term. Policymakers must weigh the trade-offs between innovation, inclusivity, and security as electronic payments reshape the economy.",

      "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6), was signed into law on February 15, 2019. The act included a total of $647.0 million in funding for three trade-related agencies under the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) account—the International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). This represents a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA (a 0.4% increase from the FY2018 appropriation), $95.0 million in funding for USITC (a 1.4% increase), and a total of $68.0 million for USTR (a 0.2% decrease). The Administration's Request On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The FY2019 proposal included a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, an 8.9% decrease from FY2018 total appropriated amounts for these agencies. The Administration requested reducing funding for all three trade-related agencies. For FY2019, the request included $440.1 million in direct funding for ITA (an 8.7% decrease from the FY2018 appropriation), $87.6 million for USITC (a 6.5% decrease), and $63.0 million for USTR (a 13.2% decrease). Congressional Actions In the spring of 2018, the House and Senate reported FY2019 CJS appropriations bills, which included proposed funding for ITA, USITC, and USTR. The reported bills did not adopt many of the Administration's budget reductions, and instead proposed funding levels that were more similar to the FY2018-enacted amounts. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018. The House proposal recommended a total of $647.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This proposal was $56.8 million more (9.6%) than the Administration's request, and $0.7 million less (-0.1%) than the FY2018-enacted legislation. The House committee proposed $480.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95.0 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, comprised of $57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for trade enforcement activities as authorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125). The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3072 on June 14, 2018. The Senate committee-reported proposal recommended a total of $655.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This is $64.8 million (11.0%) more than the Administration's request and $7.3 million (1.1%) more than the FY2018-enacted appropriations. The Senate committee proposed $488.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95 million for USITC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, comprised of $57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for trade enforcement activities. After three continuing resolutions and a three-week lapse in funding, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act. 2019 (P.L. 116-6), which was signed into law on February 15, 2019. The act included a total of $647.0 million in funding for the three trade-related agencies, which represented a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 funding levels."

      "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and Central Utah Project (CUP); the Department of Energy (DOE); the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); and several other independent agencies. DOE typically accounts for about 80% of the bill's funding. President Trump submitted his FY2020 detailed budget proposal to Congress on March 18, 2019 (after submitting a general budget overview on March 11). The budget requests for agencies included in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill total $38.02 billion—$6.64 billion (15%) below the FY2019 appropriation. The largest exception to the overall decrease proposed for energy and water programs is a $1.309 billion increase (12%) for DOE nuclear weapons activities. For FY2019, the conference agreement on H.R. 5895 (H.Rept. 115-929) provided total Energy and Water Development appropriations of $44.66 billion—3% above the FY2018 level, excluding supplemental funding, and 23% above the FY2019 request. It was signed by the President on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244). Emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $17.419 billion were provided to USACE and DOE for hurricane response by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), signed February 9, 2018. Major Energy and Water Development funding issues for FY2020 are listed below. They were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations. Water Agency Funding Reductions. The Trump Administration requested reductions of 31% for USACE and 29% for Reclamation for FY2020 from the FY2019 enacted levels. The largest reductions would be from USACE Operation and Maintenance (-48%) and Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account (-31%). Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Power Marketing Administration (PMA) Reforms. DOE's FY2020 budget request includes mandatory proposals to sell PMA electricity transmission lines and other assets, repeal certain PMA borrowing authority, and eliminate cost-based limits on the electricity rates charged by the PMAs. The proposals would need to be enacted in authorizing legislation. Termination of Energy Efficiency Grants. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would be terminated under the FY2020 budget request. The Administration had proposed to eliminate the grants in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress continued funding. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2020 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would be reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 83%, nuclear energy by 38%, and fossil energy by 24%. Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would provide new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's repository license application. Similar Administration funding requests for FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Elimination of Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E). The Trump Administration proposes no new appropriations for ARPA-E in FY2020 and to cancel $287 million in unobligated balances from previous appropriations. Similar proposals to terminate ARPA-E in FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Loan Programs Termination. The FY2020 budget request would terminate DOE's Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Administration proposals to eliminate the programs were not included in the enacted appropriations measures for FY2018 and FY2019. Weapons Activities. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than it was in FY2019 ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion), in contrast to a proposed 10% reduction in DOE's total funding. Notable proposed increases would be used for warhead life extension programs and preparations for increase production of plutonium pits (warhead cores)."

      "The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-578) created the LWCF in the Treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program—State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of the total appropriation for other purposes since FY1998."

However, traditional supporters oppose diverting funds from land acquisition and state grants. Recent legislative proposals have sought to authorize new uses, but none have been enacted.  \n\nAppropriations for \"other purposes\" have fluctuated, peaking at $456 million in FY2001 under the Clinton Administration’s Lands Legacy Initiative. Since FY2008, funding has primarily supported two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation grants, which together account for 63% of \"other purpose\" spending.  \n\nKey programs funded by LWCF include:  \n- **Forest Legacy**: Protects private forests from development through state-federal partnerships ($944.4 million since FY1998).  \n- **Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund**: Supports habitat conservation on non-federal lands ($753.3 million).  \n- **State and Tribal Wildlife Grants**: Funds wildlife conservation efforts ($448.5 million until FY2007, now funded separately).  \n\nThe report highlights ongoing tensions between preserving LWCF’s original mission and expanding its scope to address broader priorities. Future decisions will shape whether the fund remains focused on recreation and land acquisition or diversifies to meet other environmental and infrastructure needs.  \n\n**Appendices**:  \n- **Appendix A**: Total LWCF appropriations for \"other purposes\" ($2.7 billion from FY1998–FY2019).  \n- **Appendix B**: Annual breakdown of \"other purpose\" appropriations, showing variability in funding levels and programs supported.  \n\n(Word count: ~500; fits one page when formatted concisely.)",

      "USPS is required to prefund its share of health benefits costs for its retirees. To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. USPS agreed that congressional action is needed and offered views on some policy approaches discussed in this report."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on Postal Retiree Health Benefits**  \n\nThe report examines the financial challenges facing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in funding retiree health benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Approximately 500,000 postal retirees participate in FEHBP, with costs shared among USPS, the federal government, and retirees. The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) required USPS to prefund these benefits, creating the Retiree Health Benefits (RHB) Fund. However, USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in required payments since 2010, and the fund is projected to be depleted by 2030.  \n\nUSPS’s financial condition is deteriorating due to declining mail volume, limited revenue options, and mounting liabilities. If the RHB Fund is exhausted, USPS would be required to resume pay-as-you-go payments, but its ability to do so is uncertain given its $65 billion in net losses over the past decade. Depletion of the fund could disrupt retiree benefits, leaving Congress to address the funding gap.  \n\nThe report identifies eight policy approaches to improve sustainability, categorized as:  \n1. **Shifting costs to the federal government** (e.g., Medicare integration or supplemental appropriations).  \n2. **Reducing benefits or increasing costs for retirees/employees** (e.g., tightening eligibility, raising premiums).  \n3. **Changing financing methods** (e.g., fixed subsidies, outside investment, or reducing prefunding targets).  \n\nKey considerations include trade-offs between USPS’s solvency, retiree security, and federal budget impacts. For example, Medicare integration could reduce USPS costs but increase Medicare expenses, while reducing prefunding could risk future shortfalls.  \n\nThe report emphasizes the need for congressional action to ensure long-term sustainability, as delays could exacerbate financial risks for retirees, USPS, and taxpayers. Stakeholders, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and USPS, concur on the urgency but differ on specific solutions.  \n\nIn conclusion, the RHB Fund’s unsustainability demands prompt legislative intervention to balance fiscal responsibility with retiree welfare. Congress must evaluate the outlined approaches to secure the future of postal retiree health benefits.  \n\n---  \n*This summary distills the report’s key findings, financial projections, and policy options into a concise overview.*",

      "To reform the federal government and make it more efficient and effective, agencies need to use data about program performance. The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges. OMB had no comments on this report."

      "The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress."

Established to provide low-cost electricity to public utilities and cooperatives, particularly in underserved areas, these PMAs face evolving challenges, including financial sustainability, environmental regulations, and privatization debates.  \n\n**Key Functions and Challenges:**  \n1. **Bonneville Power Administration (BPA):** The largest in transmission infrastructure, BPA markets power from 31 federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. Unlike other PMAs, it is self-funded through power sales and Treasury borrowing. However, competition from renewables and debt management pressures (e.g., $5.53 billion in outstanding bonds) threaten its rate stability. BPA’s participation in the Regional Cooperation Agreement aims to refinance debt but shifts costs to ratepayers. Environmental lawsuits over dam operations (e.g., salmon protection) further complicate its operations.  \n\n2. **Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA):** The smallest PMA, SEPA markets power from 22 Corps-operated dams but owns no transmission lines. Aging infrastructure and excess capacity due to overestimated demand growth have led to contract terminations by some customers.  \n\n3. **Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA):** SWPA balances hydropower sales with flood control in six states. Drought-prone, rain-fed reservoirs force reliance on purchased power during dry periods, requiring flexible congressional funding to stabilize rates.  \n\n4. **Western Area Power Administration (WAPA):** The newest and largest PMA by service area, WAPA integrates renewables and addresses transmission congestion. Its Transmission Infrastructure Program (TIP) funds grid upgrades, though proposed budget cuts threaten this authority. Drought conditions have prompted rate adjustments, with partial relief achieved in 2017.  \n\n**Privatization Debates:**  \nThe Trump Administration’s 2018 proposal to sell federal transmission assets—citing $9.5 billion in savings—was shelved due to opposition. Critics argue privatization could undermine statutory mandates for low-cost power and preference for public utilities. Congress has historically blocked such efforts, including via a 1986 law prohibiting unauthorized asset transfers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPMAs play a critical role in delivering affordable hydropower, but face financial, environmental, and policy challenges. While adapting to market shifts (e.g., renewable energy growth), their federal ownership and mission remain contentious, balancing public service with fiscal and ecological constraints.  \n\n*(Word count: 300; formatted for conciseness and clarity.)*",

      "VA has pressing infrastructure needs. The Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorized VA to accept donated real property—such as buildings or facility construction or improvements—through a pilot program. VA has initiated one project in Omaha, Nebraska, through a partnership with a donor group. VA can accept up to five donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021. The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs. GAO is recommending that VA: (1) establish pilot program objectives, (2) develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan, and (3) document roles and responsibilities and identify available and needed staff resources. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations."

However, the report identifies challenges in scaling the program, primarily due to reliance on large philanthropic donations and VA’s lack of marketing expertise to attract donors. Additionally, VA has not yet established clear objectives, an evaluation plan, or a structured framework to assess the pilot’s success and scalability.  \n\nKey findings include:  \n1. **Lack of Clear Objectives**: VA stakeholders have not collectively defined measurable goals for the pilot, hindering effective evaluation and scalability decisions.  \n2. **Incomplete Assessment Methodology**: While some offices document lessons learned, VA lacks a systematic approach to gather and analyze data for evaluating the pilot’s performance.  \n3. **Unclear Roles and Resources**: Leadership and staffing for the pilot remain fragmented, with no dedicated team or documented responsibilities, slowing implementation.  \n\nThe report recommends that VA:  \n1.

      "The SFSP, a federal nutrition assistance program, is intended to provide food to children in low-income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation. In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."

This report (1) describes HHS's key efforts to expand access to MAT, (2) examines HHS's evaluation, if any, of its efforts to expand access to MAT, and (3) describes efforts by selected stakeholders (states, private health insurers, and national associations) to expand access to MAT. GAO gathered information from HHS officials as well as a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders selected based on their MAT expansion activities, among other factors. GAO also assessed HHS's evaluation plans using internal control standards for defining objectives and evaluating results. In an effort to reduce the prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a goal to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders—four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation. While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability. In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible. In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts: States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location. Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications. National associations. Officials told GAO that they are conducting outreach and training for their members and developing tools and resource guides. For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers. GAO recommends that HHS take two actions: (1) establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT, and (2) establish timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts to expand access to MAT. HHS concurred with both recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on Expanding Access to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Opioid Use Disorders**  \n\nThe report highlights the critical role of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) in addressing opioid use disorders (OUDs), which involve medications like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone combined with behavioral therapy. MAT has proven more effective than abstinence-based treatments in reducing opioid misuse and improving patient retention. However, barriers such as limited provider availability, stigma, and diversion risks hinder access to these life-saving treatments.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Federal Efforts to Expand MAT Access:**  \n   - The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has launched five major initiatives (2015–2017), including four grant programs targeting rural areas, health centers, and state-level opioid crisis responses. These programs aim to increase MAT providers, train practitioners, and integrate MAT into primary care.  \n   - HHS also expanded the number of patients that qualified practitioners can treat with buprenorphine (up to 275 patients) and allowed nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe it under the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA).  \n\n2. **Challenges and Gaps:**  \n   - Despite progress, HHS lacks specific performance measures and targets to evaluate the effectiveness of its MAT expansion efforts. Without these, assessing progress toward closing the treatment gap (estimated at 1 million people in 2012) is difficult.  \n   - HHS has not finalized timeframes for evaluating its initiatives, risking delays in identifying needed adjustments.  \n\n3. **State and Private Sector Efforts:**  \n   - States are using federal grants to implement models like \"hub-and-spoke\" (integrating MAT into primary care) and telehealth to reach rural areas.  \n   - Private insurers are removing prior authorization requirements, modifying coverage, and incentivizing MAT use to improve access.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. **Establish Performance Measures:** HHS should define clear metrics (e.g., prescription rates, provider capacity) and targets to track MAT access expansion.  \n2. **Finalize Evaluation Timeframes:** HHS must set deadlines for evaluating its initiatives to ensure timely adjustments and accountability.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile HHS has made strides in promoting MAT, systematic evaluation and measurable goals are essential to ensure these efforts effectively combat the opioid epidemic. Addressing these gaps will help bridge the treatment divide and save lives.  \n\n---  \n*Word count: ~300 (one page)*",

      "Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits. Congress's decisions on OCO/GWOT designations will affect how much agency funding is available for military operations and foreign affairs activities overseas, how much is subject to the BCA caps, and how much is incorporated into regular budgets and long-term budget projections."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Report on War-Related and Emergency-Designated Funding Since FY2001**  \n\nSince the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress has appropriated approximately **$2 trillion** in discretionary budget authority designated for emergencies or Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT). This funding supports U.S. military, diplomatic, and security efforts, with the majority allocated to the Department of Defense (DOD, $1.8 trillion), followed by the Department of State and USAID ($154 billion), and the Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard ($3 billion).  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **OCO/GWOT Funding Trends**:  \n   - OCO funding peaked in FY2008 at $187 billion (28% of DOD’s budget) during the Iraq surge but remained elevated despite troop drawdowns. In FY2019, OCO funding totaled $69 billion (10% of DOD’s budget).  \n   - Unlike past conflicts (e.g., Vietnam), post-9/11 operations relied heavily on supplemental/OCO funding (averaging 17% of DOD’s budget vs. 6% during Vietnam).  \n\n2. **Controversial Uses of OCO**:  \n   - Critics argue OCO has become a \"slush fund\" for non-war activities (e.g., European Deterrence Initiative, F-35 fighter jets), circumventing Budget Control Act (BCA) spending caps.  \n   - DOD acknowledges 19% of recent OCO funds ($68 billion from FY2015–FY2019) supported non-war activities.  \n\n3. **Budgetary Flexibility vs. Accountability**:  \n   - OCO funding is exempt from BCA caps, allowing Congress and the President to increase defense spending without triggering sequestration.  \n   - The Obama Administration shifted from supplemental requests to regular appropriations for predictable war costs, rebranding \"GWOT\" as \"OCO\" in 2009.  \n\n4. **Troop Levels vs. Costs**:  \n   - While troop numbers in Afghanistan/Iraq fell by 90% from FY2008 to FY2019, OCO funding dropped only 63%, attributed to fixed infrastructure and support costs.  \n\n5. **Future Challenges**:  \n   - The Trump Administration proposed reducing OCO reliance by shifting $20 billion to the base budget in FY2019, but debates persist over OCO’s role in long-term defense strategy.  \n   - The BCA’s FY2020–2021 caps may force Congress to choose between raising limits, repealing the BCA, or relying further on OCO.  \n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nOCO funding has provided critical flexibility for post-9/11 operations but faces scrutiny for obscuring true defense costs and enabling budgetary workarounds. As geopolitical priorities shift toward great-power competition, Congress must reassess OCO’s scope to ensure transparency and alignment with national security goals.  \n\n**Sources**: CRS reports, DOD data, and GAO analyses.  \n\n*(Word count: ~500; fits one page at standard formatting.)*",

      "In October 2017, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced that the projected life-cycle cost of the 2020 Census had climbed to $15.6 billion, a more than $3 billion (27 percent) increase over its 2015 estimate. A high-quality, reliable cost estimate is a key tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. Without this capability, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing program cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. GAO was asked to evaluate the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's revised life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census and the extent to which the Bureau is using it as a management tool, and compares the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence from Bureau officials responsible for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate and used its cost assessment guide ( GAO-09-3SP ) as criteria. Since 2015, the Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in improving its ability to develop a reliable cost estimate. While improvements have been made, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect all the characteristics of a reliable estimate. (See figure.) Specifically, for the characteristic of being well-documented, GAO found that some of the source data either did not support the information described in the cost estimate or was not in the files provided for two of its largest field operations. In GAO's assessment of the 2015 version of the 2020 Census cost estimate, GAO recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that each of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate is met. The Bureau agreed and has taken steps, but has not fully implemented this recommendation. A reliable cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, helping management make informed decisions. During this review, GAO found the Bureau used the cost estimate to inform decision making. Factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: Changes in assumptions. Among other changes, a decrease in the assumed rate for self-response from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5 percent in 2017 increased the cost of collecting responses from nonresponding housing units. Improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk. In general, contingency allocations designed to address the effects of potential risks increased overall from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017. An overall increase in information technology (IT) costs. IT cost increases, totaling $1.59 billion, represented almost 50 percent of the total cost increase from 2015 to 2017. GAO is not making any new recommendations but maintains its earlier recommendation—that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. In its response to this report, Commerce generally agreed with the findings related to cost estimation improvements, but disagreed that the cost estimate was not reliable. However, until GAO's recommendation is fully implemented the cost estimate cannot be considered reliable."

A reliable cost estimate is critical for effective budgeting, planning, and decision-making to avoid cost overruns and operational shortfalls.  \n\n### **Key Findings:**  \n1. **Progress Made, but Reliability Not Fully Achieved**  \n   - The Bureau’s 2017 cost estimate ($15.6 billion) showed significant improvement over the 2015 version ($12.3 billion), meeting or substantially meeting three of the four reliability criteria (**accurate, credible, comprehensive**).  \n   - However, it only **partially met** the **well-documented** requirement due to insufficient documentation, inconsistent data sources, and difficulties in replicating calculations. Without full transparency, management cannot confidently use the estimate for decision-making.  \n\n2. **Cost Increases and Key Drivers**  \n   - The $3.3 billion increase from 2015 to 2017 was attributed to:  \n     - **Revised operational assumptions** (e.g., lower self-response rates, higher field data collection costs).  \n     - **Increased IT expenses** (up by $1.59 billion, including system integration and contract updates).  \n     - **Higher contingency funding** (rising from $1.35 billion to $2.6 billion) to account for risks like cybersecurity threats and natural disasters.  \n\n3. **Risk Management Improvements**  \n   - The Bureau conducted sensitivity analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and independent cost estimates (ICEs) to assess uncertainty. However, GAO found that a $1.2 billion contingency for \"unknown-unknowns\" lacked clear justification.  \n\n4. **Bureau’s Response**  \n   - The Department of Commerce disagreed with GAO’s \"not reliable\" assessment, citing internal reviews and ICEs. However, GAO maintains that **full documentation is essential** for reliability.  \n\n### **Conclusion and Recommendation**  \nWhile the Bureau has strengthened its cost estimation process, GAO reiterates its 2016 recommendation to **fully meet all reliability criteria**, particularly in documentation. A reliable estimate is vital for managing the 2020 Census effectively and ensuring accountability. Until the Bureau addresses these gaps, the estimate remains a limited tool for decision-making.  \n\n**GAO maintains that adherence to best practices is necessary to mitigate risks and support successful program execution.**  \n\n*(End of Summary)*",

      "SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so. Its systems support a range of activities, such as processing Disability Insurance payments, to calculating and withholding Medicare premiums, and issuing Social Security numbers and cards. For fiscal year 2018, the agency planned to spend approximately $1.6 billion on IT. GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the agency plans to implement the recommendation by the end of this month. GAO has made 15 recommendations to SSA to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations from 2011 through 2018, and 1 recommendation to improve its CIO policies. While SSA has implemented nearly all of them, it would be better positioned to overcome longstanding IT management challenges when it addresses the CIO's role in its policies."

      "This report provides an overview and analysis of FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The primary focus of this report is on congressional direction and funding provided to DHS through the appropriations process. It includes an Appendix with definitions of key budget terms used throughout the suite of Congressional Research Service reports on homeland security appropriations. It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018. The resolution, which covered DHS along with several other departments and agencies, continued funding at a rate of operations equal to FY2018 with some exceptions. This continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, after which point annual appropriations lapsed. A partial government shutdown ensued for 35 days until continuing appropriations were resumed January 25, 2019, by P.L. 116-5. P.L. 116-6, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, was passed by Congress on February 14, 2019, and signed into law the following day. Division A of the act included the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, which included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters, and $165 million in OCO funding for the Coast Guard. This report will be updated in the event of FY2019 supplemental appropriations actions."

Funding was restored in January 2019, and a final bill (P.L. 116-6) was enacted in February 2019, providing $49.41 billion in discretionary funding—$2.04 billion above the request.  \n\n3. **Component Funding**:  \n   - **Title I (Departmental Management)**: Received $1.88 billion, a 37.7% increase over FY2018.  \n   - **Title II (Security/Enforcement)**: Allocated $40 billion, with increases for border security and immigration enforcement.  \n   - **Title III (Disaster Relief)**: Funded at $18.27 billion, including $12 billion for disaster relief—80% above the request.  \n   - **Title IV (R&D/Training)**: Received $1.62 billion, a 10.4% increase over FY2018.  \n\n4. **Budgetary Adjustments**:  \n   - The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 revised discretionary spending caps, allowing adjustments for disaster relief and emergencies.  \n   - FY2019 disaster relief funding utilized a $14.965 billion cap adjustment, the second-largest in history.  \n\n5. **Common Appropriations Structure (CAS)**: DHS continued transitioning to CAS for FY2019, standardizing budget formats across components except the Coast Guard, which faced system constraints.  \n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nThe FY2019 DHS appropriations process reflected congressional prioritization of border security and disaster response, leading to higher funding than requested. The report underscores the complexity of DHS budgeting, including discretionary vs. mandatory spending, offsets, and adjustments. For further details, readers are directed to CRS experts and supplemental reports on DHS funding trends.  \n\n---  \n*This summary condenses the report’s analysis of FY2019 DHS appropriations, emphasizing funding comparisons, legislative actions, and key budgetary mechanisms.*",

      "Gender-related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender. While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness. However, given the limited consumer concern, they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender-related price differences into their existing consumer education resources."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Government Report on Gender-Based Price Differences in Consumer Products and Services**  \n\nThis report examines gender-based price differences in consumer products and services, focusing on personal care items, credit markets, and other sectors. Key findings include:  \n\n1. **Price Differences in Personal Care Products**:  \n   - In 5 of 10 analyzed product categories (e.g., deodorants, razors), women’s versions were priced higher than men’s after adjusting for size and observable factors like branding and packaging. Men’s products were costlier in 2 categories.  \n   - Differences may stem from gendered marketing, manufacturing costs, or firms charging based on perceived willingness to pay. However, the extent of gender bias versus legitimate cost factors remains unclear.  \n\n2. **Non-Differentiated Markets (Credit, Auto, Housing)**:  \n   - **Credit Markets**: Studies show women often pay higher mortgage rates, partly due to weaker credit profiles, but some research found no significant gender disparity after controlling for risk factors. Small business loan studies noted higher denial rates for women, often linked to business characteristics rather than direct discrimination.  \n   - **Auto Sales/Repairs**: Older studies suggest women were quoted higher prices, but gaps narrowed with online purchases, where negotiation biases are reduced.  \n\n3. **Federal and State Oversight**:  \n   - No federal law prohibits gender-based pricing, but fair lending laws (e.g., Equal Credit Opportunity Act) bar sex discrimination in credit and housing. Agencies like the CFPB, FTC, and HUD monitor complaints but report few related to gender pricing.  \n   - States like California and cities like NYC have laws banning gender-based price discrimination for services (e.g., dry cleaning), though enforcement relies heavily on consumer complaints.  \n\n4. **Consumer Awareness and Challenges**:  \n   - Price differences are hard to identify due to product differentiation (e.g., scents, packaging). Few complaints suggest low awareness or reluctance to report.  \n   - Agencies provide general anti-discrimination resources but lack targeted materials on gender pricing.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While gender-based price differences exist, their causes—costs versus bias—are unclear. Limited complaints and regulatory gaps highlight challenges in addressing potential inequities. State laws offer models for transparency, but broader solutions require better data and consumer education.  \n\n*(Word count: 298)*",

      "The Forest Service, an agency within USDA, performs a variety of tasks as steward of 193 million acres of public forests and grasslands. Its budget execution process for carrying out its mission includes (1) allotments, which are authorizations by an agency to incur obligations within a specified amount, and (2) unliquidated obligations, which represent budgetary resources that have been committed but not yet paid. Deobligation refers to an agency's cancellation or downward adjustments of previously incurred obligations, which may result in funds that may be available for reobligation. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's internal controls over its budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) review and certification of unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report findings."

However, a review of its budget execution processes identified significant deficiencies in internal controls, increasing risks of mismanagement, inefficiency, and noncompliance with federal laws.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Budget Allotments and Fund Controls**:  \n   - USFS lacked processes to ensure funds were used as designated by Congress. For example, in 2015, $35 million of a $65 million allocation for aircraft acquisitions was diverted.  \n   - No system existed to review unobligated funds from prior years, risking excess budget requests. Over $351 million in unused funds (some dating to 1999) were not reassessed.  \n   - The agency’s administrative fund control system was decentralized, undocumented, and inconsistent with USDA and OMB requirements.  \n\n2. **Wildfire Suppression Fund Transfers**:  \n   - Control activities for transferring funds to wildfire programs were poorly designed, lacking documented strategies or risk assessments.  \n\n3. **Reimbursable Agreements**:  \n   - Fire incident cooperative agreements lacked standardized processes, leading to delayed cost settlements (some taking years) and untracked receivables.  \n   - Reimbursable agreements (RACAs) had outdated guidance, inconsistent procedures, and no formal review of partners’ financial viability.  \n   - Incompatible duties were not segregated; staff negotiating agreements could also cancel receivables, increasing fraud risks.  \n\n4. **Unliquidated Obligations**:  \n   - Reviews of $2.6 billion in unliquidated obligations (funds committed but unspent) were untimely and noncompliant with USDA policy. Certifications were delayed, hindering fund availability.  \n\n### Recommendations:  \nThe report urges the USFS Chief to:  \n1. Strengthen controls to ensure funds are used as appropriated.  \n2. Implement processes to review unobligated balances annually.  \n3. Develop a comprehensive, USDA-approved fund control system.  \n4. Improve wildfire fund transfer protocols and agreement oversight.  \n5. Update RACA policies and segregate high-risk duties.  \n6. Enhance unliquidated obligation reviews and documentation.  \n7. Mandate 5-year reviews of all directives and approve supplemental guidance.  \n\n### Agency Response:  \nUSFS agreed with the findings and cited progress in revising financial policies and obligation reviews. However, continued oversight is needed to ensure reforms are fully implemented.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Without corrective action, USFS risks inefficiency, financial waste, and legal noncompliance, undermining its mission to protect public lands.  \n\n*(Word count: 300)*",

      "NSF has identified potential benefits and challenges associated with its use of rotators. Benefits include fresh perspectives and close connections to the scientific community, while challenges include staffing turnover and higher costs for some rotators compared with permanent employees. GAO was asked to review NSF's use and management of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs, among other things. This report examines (1) the number, costs, and uses of NSF rotators for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017; (2) the strategies NSF has used to manage rotator costs and the results of these efforts; and (3) the extent to which NSF has a workforce strategy for using rotators and has evaluated the results of its rotator programs. GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. The numbers of rotators—outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment—at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018. NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult. Without a workforce strategy and evaluation of results, NSF is limited in its ability to manage and, if warranted, adjust its use of rotators. GAO recommends that NSF develop an agency-wide strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with permanent staff and evaluate the contributions of its rotator programs toward NSF's human capital goals and programmatic results. NSF agreed with GAO's recommendations."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Rotator Programs Report**  \n\nThe NSF relies on two programs to bring temporary staff (rotators) into the agency: the **Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA)** program and the **Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE)** program. While both programs serve to infuse NSF with external expertise, they differ in key ways:  \n- **IPA rotators** remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing a portion of their salaries and benefits. Their pay is uncapped and may exceed federal salary limits.  \n- **VSEE rotators** are appointed as federal employees on leave from their institutions, with NSF directly paying their salaries (capped at federal limits) and reimbursing some benefits.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Workforce Composition:** From 2008–2017, IPA rotators comprised ~12% of NSF’s workforce (primarily in executive and program director roles), while VSEE rotators accounted for ~3% (mostly in program director roles). The proportion of IPA rotators in executive positions has risen, reaching 33% in 2017.  \n2. **Cost Management:** In 2017, NSF adopted three strategies to control IPA program costs:  \n   - Requiring home institutions to cover ≥10% of rotators’ salaries/benefits.  \n   - Limiting NSF-funded trips to home institutions to 12 per year.  \n   - Ending reimbursements for lost consulting income.  \n   Preliminary data show cost savings, but NSF has not fully evaluated long-term impacts.  \n3. **Workforce Strategy Gaps:** NSF lacks an agency-wide strategy to balance rotator and permanent staff use, despite recommendations from its **IPA Steering Committee**. The committee emphasized the need for workforce planning to optimize rotator-federal employee pairings, which NSF has not yet implemented.  \n4. **Program Evaluation:** NSF has not assessed how rotators contribute to **human capital goals** or **programmatic outcomes** (e.g., scientific leadership, research innovation). Without this, NSF cannot demonstrate the programs’ value or adjust their scope effectively.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. NSF should develop an **agency-wide workforce strategy** to balance rotator and permanent staff use, integrating it into reform or human capital plans.  \n2. NSF should **evaluate the rotator programs’ impacts** on human capital and mission goals to inform future decisions.  \n\nNSF concurred with the recommendations, acknowledging their potential to strengthen workforce planning. Addressing these gaps would enhance NSF’s ability to leverage rotators effectively while maintaining institutional knowledge and career advancement opportunities for permanent staff.  \n\n---  \n*This summary condenses a detailed report on NSF’s rotator programs, highlighting governance, costs, and strategic challenges.*",

      "In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."

The Controlled Substances Act mandates that manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers of controlled substances register with the DEA unless exempt. In 2010, the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act (Disposal Act) expanded the DEA’s role by authorizing public disposal of unused prescription drugs through three methods: permanent disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Law enforcement agencies may use these methods without DEA authorization, but other entities—such as pharmacies, hospitals, and narcotic treatment programs—must modify their DEA registration to become authorized collectors.  \n\nAs of April 2017, only 2.49% of eligible entities (2,233 out of 89,550) had registered as authorized collectors, with pharmacies comprising 81% of participants. Participation rates varied significantly by state, with North Dakota leading at 32% due to state-funded support for disposal bins. Conversely, Connecticut, Missouri, and Maine had the lowest participation rates (below 1%). Urban areas housed 82% of authorized collectors, but rural areas had a higher proportion of eligible entities participating. Approximately half of the U.S. population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin, though access was far lower in rural areas (13%) compared to urban areas (52%).  \n\nStakeholders identified key barriers to participation:  \n1. **Costs**: Purchasing, installing, and maintaining disposal bins, along with contracting reverse distributors for destruction, can be expensive. Some entities offset costs through external funding or local ordinances requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to share disposal costs.  \n2. **Uncertainty**: Ambiguity around DEA regulations, particularly the \"non-retrievable\" destruction standard, discouraged participation. Reverse distributors expressed confusion over compliant disposal methods, and some noted conflicts with state/federal hazardous waste rules.  \n3. **Alternative Programs**: Many entities relied on existing disposal options, such as law enforcement take-back programs or long-term care facility processes, reducing incentives to join the DEA’s initiative.  \n\nThe DEA does not track usage data (e.g., volume or types of drugs collected), citing diversion risks and its limited role in overseeing disposal bin operations. While the program expands public access to safe disposal, low participation among eligible entities and geographic disparities in access remain challenges. The report recommends improved DEA communication and guidance to address stakeholder concerns and boost engagement.  \n\n*Key Takeaway*: The DEA’s drug disposal program provides critical diversion prevention, but broader participation and clearer regulations are needed to enhance its effectiveness, particularly in underserved rural communities.",

      "Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."

The ISC Standard, developed after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, requires agencies to assess threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for undesirable events (e.g., active shooters, explosions) and implement tailored countermeasures. The report focuses on four agencies: **Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service**.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Misalignment with ISC Standards**:  \n   - None of the agencies fully adhered to the ISC Standard. While all referenced it, their methodologies failed to assess all 33 undesirable events or consistently evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.  \n   - **CBP** omitted threat and consequence assessments, relying on outdated policies. **FAA** used a blanket \"baseline threat\" approach rather than facility-specific risks. **ARS and the Forest Service** followed a USDA methodology that excluded newer ISC requirements.  \n\n2. **Resource Allocation Challenges**:  \n   - Agencies lacked data to prioritize security investments effectively. For example, **FAA mandated X-ray machines for all high-risk facilities without risk assessments**, potentially wasting resources.

      "The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Surety Bond Guarantee Program is designed to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracts, by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds for small businesses that cannot obtain surety bonds through regular commercial channels. The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The limit had been $2 million since 2000, with a temporary increase from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that such a guarantee was necessary. Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses. This report examines the program's origin and development, including (1) the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program that initially provided a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed surety bonds without the SBA's prior approval; (2) P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and (3) the decision to increase the program's bond limit."

      "Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to \"declare\" a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). In the interest of saving time, the authority to make the declaration has been delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Regional Administrators. Once issued, the FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal fire suppression assistance such as the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on certain public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster. This federal assistance requires a cost-sharing component such that state, local, and tribal governments are responsible for 25% of the expenses.

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) Report**  \n\nThe Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) program, authorized under Section 420 of the Stafford Act, provides federal assistance to state, local, and tribal governments for wildfire suppression activities. Established in 2001, FMAGs are administered by FEMA’s Regional Administrators and cover 75% of eligible costs, with grantees responsible for the remaining 25%.  \n\n**Request Process and Eligibility**  \nFMAGs can be requested by a governor or tribal leader when a wildfire threatens to become a major disaster. Requests are submitted to FEMA, often by phone for expediency, followed by written confirmation within 14 days. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 granted tribes the same request authority as states. Requests must include fire details (size, population threatened, evacuations, resource commitments) and cost estimates.  \n\nFEMA evaluates requests based on:  \n- Threats to lives, property, and critical infrastructure.  \n- Availability of state/local resources.  \n- Fire danger indices (e.g., National Fire Danger Ratings System).  \n- Economic impacts.  \n- Cost thresholds (individual or cumulative, varying by state). For example, Pennsylvania’s individual threshold is $927,274, while its cumulative threshold is $2.78 million.  \n\n**Appeals and Funding**  \nDenied requests may be appealed within 30 days, with FEMA’s final decision issued within 90 days. FMAGs are funded through FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which carries over unused funds annually. Unlike other DRF categories, FMAGs are drawn from \"base funding\" and do not affect major disaster allocations.  \n\n**Assistance Scope**  \nFMAGs cover:  \n- Equipment, personnel, and emergency work (e.g., evacuations, traffic control).  \n- Overtime for public safety personnel (not regular salaries).  \n- Mitigation grants under the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (up to 15% of assistance costs).  \n\n**Coordination with Federal Agencies**  \nFMAGs generally do not overlap with federal land suppression efforts (e.g., Forest Service). Exceptions include mixed-ownership lands or cooperative agreements (\"fire compacts\") where states assume suppression costs. Tribes may also receive Bureau of Indian Affairs reimbursements for firefighting on tribal lands.  \n\nIn summary, FMAGs provide critical, timely support for wildfire response, with strict eligibility criteria and cost-sharing requirements, while complementing—not duplicating—other federal wildfire programs.",

      "The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days. For a general discussion of federal government shutdowns, see CRS Report RL34680, Shutdown of the Federal Government: Causes, Processes, and Effects, coordinated by Clinton T. Brass."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the Report on Continuing Resolutions and Funding Gaps**  \n\nFederal agencies rely on annual appropriations acts for funding. When these are delayed, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary budget authority. Since FY1977, regular appropriations have only been enacted on time four times, often necessitating CRs to avoid funding gaps—periods when no appropriations or CRs are in place. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal spending without appropriations, requiring agencies to cease operations during funding gaps, except for essential activities like protecting life and property.  \n\nFunding gaps can occur at any time, not just at the start of the fiscal year, and multiple gaps may arise within a year. Historically, gaps varied in duration and impact. Before 1980, agencies often continued operating during gaps, but after Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti’s opinions, shutdowns became more common, furloughing non-essential employees. However, short gaps or imminent CRs sometimes minimized disruptions.  \n\nSince FY1977, there have been 20 funding gaps, with most occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. Recent gaps, like those in FY1996, FY2014, FY2018, and FY2019, led to significant shutdowns, furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers. The longest gap (34 days) occurred in FY2019.  \n\nProposals for automatic CRs (ACRs) to prevent gaps have been discussed but never permanently enacted. CRs often include provisions to retroactively pay furloughed employees. While some gaps caused minimal disruption, others, particularly in recent decades, have had widespread effects, highlighting the challenges of timely appropriations.  \n\nIn conclusion, funding gaps disrupt government operations, with their severity depending on duration and agency preparedness. The trend toward more consequential shutdowns underscores the need for legislative solutions to ensure stable funding.",

      "The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act. All of the agencies either concurred or generally concurred with GAO's recommendations."

      "Research has shown that students who experience discipline that removes them from the classroom are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school, and become involved in the juvenile justice system. Studies have shown this can result in decreased earning potential and added costs to society, such as incarceration and lost tax revenue. Education and Justice are responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the administration of discipline in public schools. GAO was asked to review the use of discipline in schools. To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate. Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure). Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex—such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students. Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues. For example, both agencies investigated cases alleging discrimination. Further, to help identify persistent disparities among the nation's schools, Education collects comprehensive data on school discipline every other year through its Civil Rights Data Collection effort."

      "First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects. Air Force officials plan to complete cost estimates for those two projects in conjunction with their fiscal year 2020 budget submission."

Cobra Dane, operated by the Air Force in coordination with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), provides early tracking and classification of missile threats, particularly from North Korea, due to its strategic location at Shemya Island, Alaska. However, the report notes that Cobra Dane lacks the inherent capability to confirm successful missile interceptions—a feature mistakenly claimed in a 2018 Air Force report to Congress. MDA plans to implement software upgrades by 2025 to enable this function.  \n\nThe Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), to be operational by 2021 at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska, will complement Cobra Dane with advanced discrimination capabilities to distinguish warheads from decoys. While LRDR offers advantages in tracking later-stage missile trajectories, Cobra Dane’s location allows earlier threat detection, filling a critical coverage gap between LRDR and radars in Japan. MDA studies confirm that LRDR’s placement at Clear Air Force Station optimizes performance and cost-effectiveness.  \n\nFuture radar investments, such as the Pacific Radar (planned for 2025) and the Space Fence (operational in 2019), may reduce DOD’s reliance on Cobra Dane for BMD and space surveillance. However, Cobra Dane remains indispensable for tracking small space objects unmatched by other systems. Its operational availability has recently dipped to 88% (below the 90% requirement), primarily due to scheduled maintenance. Unscheduled outages are rare (0.3%), and DOD mitigates downtime by deploying the Sea-Based X-band radar for BMD coverage.  \n\nThe Air Force and MDA share funding for Cobra Dane’s operation, sustainment, and modernization, including upgrades to obsolete components like transmitter groups and traveling wave tubes. Challenges remain in expediting these projects without disrupting missions. The Air Force also funds sustainment of Shemya Island’s infrastructure, critical for maintaining radar access.  \n\nIn conclusion, Cobra Dane’s unique capabilities and location ensure its continued role in national defense, though emerging systems like LRDR and the Space Fence will gradually assume some functions. Coordination between the Air Force, MDA, and combatant commands remains vital to maintaining radar effectiveness and addressing sustainment challenges.  \n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Cobra Dane supports BMD, space surveillance, and intelligence, but lacks interception confirmation capability.  \n- LRDR will enhance discrimination and late-stage tracking but cannot fully replace Cobra Dane’s early-warning role.  \n- Future systems (Pacific Radar, Space Fence) may reduce but not eliminate dependence on Cobra Dane.  \n- Sustainment efforts face funding and scheduling hurdles, requiring careful management to avoid operational gaps.  \n\nFor further details, access the full report at [GAO’s website](http://www.gao.gov).  \n\n---  \n*This summary condenses the report’s findings for brevity and clarity.*",

      "The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years. On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan includes 304 ships, or an average of about 10 per year. If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. Another oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. Decisions that Congress makes regarding Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base."

The Navy’s current fleet consists of 289 battle force ships, below its 355-ship target established in 2016. The FY2020 budget requests funding for 12 new ships, including aircraft carriers, submarines, destroyers, frigates, and support vessels. Congress must decide whether to approve, modify, or reject these plans, as their decisions will significantly impact Navy capabilities, funding, and the shipbuilding industrial base.  \n\nKey issues include:  \n1. **Force Structure Assessment (FSA)**: The Navy is conducting a new FSA, expected to adjust the 355-ship goal and mix of ships, potentially shifting toward a more distributed architecture with unmanned vehicles and smaller surface combatants.  \n2. **Affordability**: The 30-year shipbuilding plan projects reaching 355 ships by 2034, but funding challenges persist, particularly during the mid-2020s to mid-2030s when procuring Columbia-class submarines and replacing aging vessels. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates costs 27% higher than Navy projections, citing inflation and uncertain future ship designs.  \n3. **Industrial Base Capacity**: The shipbuilding industry can support increased production but requires investment in workforce training and infrastructure, especially for submarines. Multi-year contracts and stable funding are critical to maintaining production efficiency.  \n4. **Strategic Context**: The Navy’s plans align with renewed great-power competition, particularly with China and Russia. However, budget constraints and shifting priorities (e.g., maintenance backlogs, technological advancements) complicate long-term feasibility.  \n\nThe report underscores the tension between ambitious fleet expansion and fiscal realities, urging Congress to balance immediate needs with sustainable investments in naval power. Decisions will shape the Navy’s ability to maintain global maritime dominance amid evolving threats.  \n\n---  \n*Note: This summary condenses the report’s key points, omitting detailed appendices on historical data, industrial base analysis, and acquisition strategies.*",

      "The VA is responsible for ensuring that veterans have reasonable access to burial options in a national or state veterans' cemetery. In fiscal year 2018 VA estimated that about 92 percent of veterans had reasonable access to burial options, which was an increase from 90 percent in fiscal year 2014 but short of its goal of 96 percent by the end of fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access. GAO recommends that NCA fully adopt cost-estimating leading practices into its procedures to assist in improving its cost estimates for establishing cemeteries. NCA concurred with our recommendation."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of the National Cemeteries Act Report**  \n\nThe National Cemeteries Act of 1973 established the modern veterans’ cemetery system, managed by the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). NCA maintains existing national cemeteries, constructs new ones, and funds state and tribal veterans’ cemeteries through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program. Since 1978, the Grants Program has supported the establishment, expansion, and improvement of cemeteries, provided they meet NCA’s operational standards.  \n\nTo improve burial access for veterans, NCA revised its policies, lowering the threshold for new cemeteries from 170,000 to 80,000 unserved veterans in an area. This change aimed to address gaps in highly populated and rural regions. NCA’s long-range plan (2018–2022) seeks to provide 95% of veterans with reasonable burial access by constructing 18 new cemeteries: five traditional, five urban (focused on columbaria for cremated remains), and eight rural sites.  \n\nHowever, progress has been slower than planned. As of September 2019, only six of the 18 planned cemeteries had opened, with delays attributed to land acquisition challenges, cost underestimations, and community resistance. For example, the Chicago site faced five failed land acquisition attempts, while the Elko, Nevada, project awaits congressional land transfer approval. Cost estimates for rural cemeteries also surged by over 200%, from $1 million to $3 million per site, due to unreliable estimating practices.  \n\nNCA’s cost-estimating guidance lacks key best practices, such as risk analysis and sensitivity assessments, increasing the risk of budget overruns. Additionally, NCA relies on county-level veteran population data rather than more precise census tract data, potentially misprioritizing unserved areas. For instance, Erie, Pennsylvania, was overestimated as a high-need area, while Decatur, Alabama, was undervalued.  \n\nThe report recommends that VA update its cost-estimating procedures to align with GAO’s best practices, ensuring reliable budgeting and project management. While VA concurred with this recommendation, it disputed the characterization of NCA’s progress as \"limited\" and maintained its opposition to using census tract data.  \n\nIn conclusion, while NCA has expanded burial access to 92% of veterans, delays, cost overruns, and data limitations hinder its goal of reaching 95%. Improved planning and data utilization are critical to fulfilling its mission of serving veterans and their families.  \n\n---  \n*Key Points:*  \n- NCA manages 155 national cemeteries and funds state/tribal cemeteries.  \n- Only 6 of 18 planned cemeteries opened by 2019, with significant delays.  \n- Rural cemetery costs tripled due to flawed estimates.  \n- County-level data may misidentify high-need veteran populations.  \n- GAO recommends adopting better cost-estimating practices and refining data analysis.",

      "The federal government owns billions of dollars of personal property—such as office furniture, scientific equipment, and industrial machinery. By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years. OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property. OMB did not comment on GAO's recommendation."

Federal agencies are required by law to maintain inventory controls, identify excess property, and dispose of it through the General Services Administration (GSA). The disposal process involves four stages: transfer to other federal or non-federal entities, donation, sale, or abandonment/destruction.  \n\nKey findings include:  \n1. **Accountability Gaps**: Agencies track high-value or sensitive items (e.g., laptops, firearms) but often neglect low-value property (e.g., office furniture), citing cost and resource constraints. Only the IRS had formal criteria for identifying excess property; other agencies relied on ad hoc \"triggering events\" like office relocations.  \n2. **Inefficient Excess Identification**: Without systematic processes, agencies risk retaining unneeded property, missing opportunities to reuse it elsewhere or reduce storage costs. Past audits (e.g., EPA, Coast Guard) highlight millions in potential savings from better management.  \n3. **Space Reduction Challenges**: Initiatives like *Freeze the Footprint* reduced federal office space by 25 million square feet (2012–2016). However, agencies struggled with disposing of outdated furniture during relocations, often recycling or discarding it due to non-compliance with modern space standards.  \n4. **Disposal Process**: GSA’s *GSAXcess* system facilitates property transfers, donations, or sales, but agencies face timing and inventory challenges during large-scale disposals. Some leveraged GSA support for training or on-site screenings.  \n\n**Recommendation**: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should issue guidance to reinforce agencies’ legal obligation to continuously assess property needs, ensuring proactive identification of excess items.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Improved policies and systematic reviews could enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and maximize the reuse of federal personal property.  \n\n*(Sources: GAO analysis of EPA, GSA, HUD, IRS, Forest Service, and OMB data; 2016–2018 audit.)*  \n\n---  \n*Note: Condensed from a 50+ page GAO report; excludes appendices and detailed methodologies.*",

As it would be a multifunctional remote control, the members were confident that it would stand alone. Moving on to the issue of the appearance, the group analyzed the problems of the existing remotes and briefly talked about the user interface as well as came up with a name of the product."

Police in Vermont say they have issued an arrest warrant for 29-year-old Jayveon Caballero, who is accused of fatally shooting Markus Austin in Montpelier early Sunday after an altercation, the Times Argus reports. Witnesses told investigators that Austin, 33, assaulted Caballero’s girlfriend, Desiree Cary, during the altercation outside a bar in the nearby city of Barre early Sunday. Police say Caballero later confronted Austin outside his apartment and shot him dead. The body was found in the parking lot of Austin's apartment complex. A Vermont State Police spokesman says Caballero, who knew Austin before the shooting, fled the town and probably the state after the shooting, WCAX reports. The police spokesman says Caballero is believed to have boarded a Greyhound bus bound for New York City on Sunday morning, which made numerous stops in other states along the way. Later Sunday, Cary, 22, was arrested on apparently unrelated charges of selling heroin and crack cocaine. With around 7,500 residents, Montpelier has the smallest population of any state capital, the AP notes. Police Chief Anthony Facos says this is the city's first murder since a woman shot her husband in the 1920s."

This marks the first murder in Montpelier—the nation’s least populous capital—in nearly a century, with the last recorded homicide dating back to the 1920s.  \n\nAccording to police, the incident stemmed from an altercation outside Gusto’s bar in Barre, where Caballero, Austin, and others had been socializing. Witnesses reported that Caballero’s girlfriend, Desiree Cary, 22, became involved in a physical confrontation with Austin, who allegedly struck her, injuring her jaw. Enraged, Caballero later confronted Austin outside his apartment and shot him. A witness, Jeff Sarpong, described seeing Caballero approach Austin’s car, fire the fatal shot, and then ask if Austin was okay before fleeing the scene.  \n\nCaballero is believed to have boarded a Greyhound bus in White River Junction, possibly heading to New York City, though authorities are uncertain if he disembarked earlier. Police have issued a second-degree murder warrant with a $500,000 bail set and are coordinating with other states to locate him. Meanwhile, Cary was arrested Sunday on unrelated drug charges after a vehicle stop in Barre. She pleaded not guilty to charges of selling crack cocaine and heroin and was released on bail.  \n\nInvestigators executed a search warrant at Caballero’s Barre residence but found no sign of him. Neighbors reported ongoing disturbances at the property, including drag racing and frequent traffic. Authorities urge anyone with information on Caballero’s whereabouts to come forward as the manhunt continues.  \n\nThe case highlights a rare violent crime in Montpelier, a city of approximately 7,500 residents, and underscores the tragic outcome of a night that began as a social gathering but ended in lethal violence.",

      "Authorities are combing through more than 1,200 leads in a desperate search for a 9-year-old girl they say was abducted by her uncle May 4, WATE reports. According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, 57-year-old Gary Simpson picked Carlie Trent up from her Tennessee school, telling staff her father had been in an accident. Shortly before, he purchased a child's nightgown, bikini, girls' underwear, lipstick, and nail polish at an area Walmart. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has pictures of those items. Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt \"sick to my stomach\" when she heard about those purchases. \"I don't know what he's done to her,\" she says. \"I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\" Authorities believe Carlie is in \"imminent danger.\" Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth. \"This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,\" a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction. Shannon Trent, who hasn't had custody of Carlie in two years, says she \"always had a bad feeling\" about Simpson. \"I should have stuck with my gut,\" she tells People.

The case, which initially captivated and horrified the public, unraveled as evidence proved scarce and inconsistencies emerged.  \n\nMurga had announced in November that police arrested four suspects who allegedly murdered up to 60 victims, extracting their fat to sell for thousands of dollars per liter to European cosmetics companies. The claim echoed the myth of the *Pishtacos*, legendary Andean killers said to harvest human fat. Police bolstered their narrative with a press conference displaying bottles of purported human fat and graphic crime scene footage. However, skepticism grew as regional police in Huanuco—excluded from the investigation—revealed only one murder victim, linked to drug trafficking, with no evidence of a fat-selling ring.  \n\nPeru’s police chief, General Miguel Hidalgo, admitted the investigation was botched, damaging the force’s credibility. Medical experts dismissed the fat-selling theory, noting human fat has no commercial value and spoils quickly. Anthropologists criticized police for exploiting folklore to sensationalize the case, while politicians accused them of harming tourism.  \n\nThe BBC’s report highlighted Murga’s suspension for tarnishing the police’s reputation and noted the lack of corroborating evidence. Experts debunked the idea of a black market for human fat, and observers suggested the story was a distraction from Peru’s real issues, such as drug-related violence.  \n\nUltimately, the case exposed systemic failures in Peruvian law enforcement, blending myth with incompetence and raising questions about the reliability of official narratives.

      "Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""

Democrats believe yielding now would embolden Republicans to demand further concessions in upcoming debt ceiling negotiations. Reid plans to swiftly strip the ACA-related amendments from the House bill when the Senate reconvenes Monday afternoon, leaving little time for compromise. Republicans, meanwhile, accuse Reid of orchestrating a shutdown for political gain, while Democrats argue the GOP’s inflexibility is to blame.  \n\nA shutdown would have severe economic consequences, particularly in the Washington, D.C., region, where an estimated 700,000 federal workers and contractors could face furloughs, costing the area $200 million daily. Critical services like Medicare and Social Security applications, housing loans, and NIH clinical trials would halt, while national parks and museums would close, hurting tourism. Local governments are bracing for lost tax revenue, with Maryland anticipating $5 million in daily losses. Though essential services like mail delivery and air traffic control would continue, delays and disruptions are expected.  \n\nThe political and economic stakes are high. Democrats believe a shutdown would damage Republicans politically, while GOP leaders fear backlash from their base if they concede. If no agreement is reached, a short-term funding extension or a brief shutdown may occur, intensifying pressure for a resolution. The outcome hinges on whether Boehner can rally House Republicans to pass a \"clean\" funding bill or if both sides dig in, prolonging the crisis.  \n\n**Key Takeaways:**  \n1. **Political Standoff:** House Republicans insist on ACA modifications, while Senate Democrats refuse to negotiate, leading to a",

      "Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says. (Mysterious plumes on Mars are stumping scientists.)"

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of Mars Water and Climate Findings**  \n\nRecent studies using advanced telescopes and atmospheric data have revealed compelling evidence about Mars' ancient water history, suggesting it once hosted vast oceans and a potentially habitable environment.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n1. **Deuterium Enrichment and Water Loss:**  \n   - Measurements of atmospheric water (H₂O) and deuterium-enriched water (HDO) on Mars show significant isotopic anomalies, indicating substantial water loss over time. The deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio is about seven times higher than Earth’s, suggesting Mars once had a global water layer at least **137 meters deep**. Polar ice reservoirs show even higher deuterium enrichment (up to 8 times Earth’s standard), while high-altitude regions exhibit lower values.  \n\n2. **Ancient Ocean Evidence:**  \n   - NASA and European Southern Observatory (ESO) researchers, using infrared telescopes (Keck II, NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility, and ESO’s Very Large Telescope), mapped Martian water vapor over six years. They concluded that **an ocean covering 20% of Mars’ surface**—comparable to Earth’s Atlantic Ocean—existed **4.5 billion years ago**. This ocean was **up to a mile deep** in places and held **20 million cubic kilometers** of water (more than Earth’s Arctic Ocean).  \n\n3. **Climate and Habitability:**  \n   - Early Mars was **warm and wet**, with rivers, lakes, and deltas persisting for **millions of years**. Over time, atmospheric thinning caused water to escape into space, leaving only **13% of the original water** locked in polar ice today. The prolonged presence of liquid water suggests Mars was **habitable for longer than previously thought**—potentially **1.5 billion years or more**, exceeding the time it took life to emerge on Earth.  \n\n4. **Scientific Implications:**  \n   - The findings challenge earlier assumptions that Mars had only sporadic water activity. Instead, it likely had **long-standing bodies of water**, raising the possibility of microbial life. While no direct evidence of life exists, the detection of methane (by NASA’s Curiosity rover) and planned missions (e.g., ESA’s ExoMars 2018) aim to explore biosignatures.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMars’ ancient ocean and stable water cycle make it a prime candidate for past habitability.

The US skiing and snowboarding teams have signed up their own private security company, Global Rescue, which claims it has six aircraft ready for an evacuation if necessary. But having planes isn't the only issue; it's having runways. Sochi's airport is fairly small, so deciding which of the 85 countries competing to use it would be a nightmare. Other teams are also taking special security precautions, the Moscow Times reports. Britain, for example, is sending extra security personnel with its delegation. A German spokesman, meanwhile, said the country trusted Russia, but would \"look closely\" at the situation. \"We will have no aircraft, that is all that I can say.\""

      "OJ Simpson's big moment has arrived. A hearing is underway at which he is trying to convince members of the Nevada Board of Parole that he should go free. \"I haven't made any excuses in the nine years that I've been here and I'm not trying to make an excuse now,\" said the 70-year-old Simpson early in the proceedings, per the AP. Later, he added, \"I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\" He also appeared to stifle a sob in his appeal to the board. Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\""

Simpson, who was granted release after serving nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. The hearing, which received extensive media coverage, evoked memories of Simpson’s infamous 1995 acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. During the hearing, Simpson, now 70, appeared energetic and remorseful, though he avoided taking full responsibility for the robbery, blaming associates for misleading him. The parole board unanimously approved his release, citing his good behavior in prison, stable release plans, and low risk of reoffending. Simpson expressed regret for the incident but maintained he had no criminal intent. His daughter Arnelle Simpson and robbery victim Bruce Fromong testified in his support, with Fromong suggesting the harsh sentence was retribution for Simpson’s 1995 acquittal. The case reignited discussions about race, justice, and celebrity culture, themes explored in recent documentaries like *O.J.: Made in America*.  \n\n**Passage 2: Internet Archive’s \"No More 404\" Initiative**  \nThe second passage discusses the Internet Archive’s efforts to preserve web content by archiving pages as they are created and storing referenced pages to prevent broken links.

      "It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room. The San Francisco Chronicle reports a 22-year-old woman reported missing in November in California was found this week—because she's a current contestant on The Bachelor. The strange story started when Bekah Martinez's mom reported her missing to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office on Nov. 18. According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person. The Bachelor started filming in September, and it's unclear if Martinez was still filming when she was reported missing. She tweets \"the scariest thing\" about being a missing person \"is that my efforts to conceal The Worst Drivers License Photo Of All Time have been thwarted\""

Bekah Martinez’s Missing Person Case**  \nRebekah Martinez, a 22-year-old woman from Fresno, was reported missing by her mother in November 2017 after she traveled to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm. Despite her mother’s concerns, Martinez was later discovered as a contestant on the reality show *The Bachelor*, where she gained attention for her 14-year age gap with the show’s lead, Arie Luyendyk Jr. After being identified by a Facebook user who recognized her from the show, authorities confirmed Martinez was safe, and her name was removed from the California Department of Justice’s missing persons list. Martinez humorously responded to the media coverage, joking about her unflattering driver’s license photo used in the missing person report.  \n\n**2. Humboldt County’s High Rate of Missing Persons**  \nA deeper investigation by the *North Coast Journal* revealed that Humboldt County has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, with 35 individuals currently listed as missing. The reasons behind this trend are complex, involving factors such as the transient nature of the cannabis industry, rural isolation, and gaps in law enforcement reporting. Many cases involve individuals who intentionally disconnect from family or are working in remote areas with no cell service. Some, like Martinez, are mistakenly listed as missing despite being safe.  \n\nThe article highlights several unresolved cases, including the decades-old disappearances of Mary Stuart and her two young children in 1977, as well as more recent cases like Jeff Joseph, a cannabis grower who vanished in 2014 under suspicious circumstances.

Today's unveiling is Sony's attempt to steal the spotlight, at least until Microsoft unveils its next Xbox in June at the E3 video game expo in Los Angeles. Among the PS4's revisions is an updated controller that adds a touchpad, motion control, and a \"share\" button. The controller also features a light bar, which means a new PlayStation camera can more easily track the device. Sony has struggled lately to keep up with Microsoft and other rivals such as Apple and Samsung.

The console, set to release in late 2013, shifts its design philosophy from raw technical power to user experience, echoing Apple’s approach to product development. The PS4 features an x86-based architecture, making it easier for developers to create games compared to the notoriously complex PS3. It includes an 8-core CPU/GPU combo, 8GB of GDDR5 memory, and a local hard drive, though solid-state storage details remain unconfirmed.  \n\nGraphically, the PS4 delivers impressive improvements, with demos showcasing advanced lighting, shadows, and real-time facial animations. However, early previews suggest the leap may not be as revolutionary as past generational shifts. Notably, the PS4 lacks native backward compatibility with PS3 games but will offer streaming access via PlayStation Cloud, though specifics on this service are unclear.  \n\nThe redesigned DualShock 4 controller introduces a touchpad, a share button, a headphone jack, and a light bar for motion tracking, eliminating the need for a separate wand. The console also emphasizes seamless gameplay with features like instant boot from sleep, background downloads, and the ability to play games while they download—addressing past complaints about slow PS3 downloads.  \n\nSocial and streaming functionalities are central to the PS4. Players can upload gameplay videos instantly, spectate others’ sessions, and even let friends take control remotely.

      "\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"

The court ruled that Nestlé failed to prove the shape was distinctive enough to consumers across all EU member states, annulling the European Union Intellectual Property Office’s (EUIPO) 2012 decision to grant the trademark. The case has been sent back to the EUIPO for reconsideration, though Nestlé remains optimistic about securing the trademark with additional evidence.  \n\nThe conflict began in 2002 when Nestlé sought EU-wide protection for the shape, described as \"four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base.\" Mondelez, which produces Norway’s Kvikk Lunsj—a similar four-finger wafer bar introduced in 1937—opposed the trademark, arguing the shape lacked distinctiveness. A 2016 lower court ruling required Nestlé to demonstrate recognition in every EU country, but evidence was lacking for Belgium, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal. The latest ruling reinforces that trademarks must meet this high standard bloc-wide, not just in \"a significant part\" of the EU.  \n\nThe outcome opens the door for generic imitations and benefits competitors like Kvikk Lunsj, which has cultural significance in Scandinavia. However, Nestlé retains national trademarks in countries like France and Germany. The case parallels other chocolate-related trademark disputes, including Cadbury’s failed attempt to trademark its purple packaging and Lindt’s loss over its gold-wrapped Easter bunnies. Meanwhile, Toblerone’s triangular shape remains protected, as demonstrated in a 2018 settlement with Poundland over a copycat product.  \n\nThe ruling has broader implications for EU trademark law, emphasizing the challenge of proving distinctiveness in diverse markets. It also briefly intersected with Brexit debates, with some UK critics framing the case as EU overreach. While Nestlé may reapply for the trademark, the decision underscores the difficulty of securing shape-based protections in the EU, leaving the future of Kit Kat’s iconic design uncertain.  \n\n(Word count: 298)",

The heavily edited video, taken from a surveillance camera, shows a car coming under fire during what the military describes as a series of ambushes that left four soldiers and six suspects dead in Palmarito on May 3. As soldiers surround the vehicle, its occupants exit and are forced to lie down in front of the car. Soldiers are then seen dragging a suspect to the same spot. He appears injured but rolls from his back onto his front. Six minutes later, a soldier appears at the side of the frame and appears to shoot the man in the back of the head, per the AP. A dark stain spreads around him, reports Reuters. \"There was already concern about the use of excessive force by the military. Now this video seems to give us the proof,\" says the chairwoman of Mexico's Senate Commission on Human Rights, per the Washington Post, which identifies the man shot as Raul Jimenez Martinez, 46. Mexico's defense ministry, however, says it will cooperate fully with an investigation launched by the attorney general's office on May 4. \"Under no circumstances can conduct contrary to the law and human rights be justified,\" the ministry says.

      "Frightened North Carolinians fleeing Irene are jamming highways as the East Coast steels for what could be the biggest hurricane in decades. At least seven states have now declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of flights are being canceled. Gas stations are running out of fuel and ATMs have been emptied of cash as Americans hit the road for a bumper-to-bumper trip out of Irene's angry path. The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow."

The storm, which had already caused significant damage in the Bahamas, was projected to follow a path similar to 1985’s Hurricane Gloria, potentially causing up to $13.9 billion in insured losses and $20 billion in overall economic damage.  \n\n**Evacuations and Emergency Preparations**  \nStates from North Carolina to New York declared states of emergency. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in coastal areas, including North Carolina’s Outer Banks, Ocean City, Maryland, and parts of New York City. Over 200,000 people were affected by evacuation orders in North Carolina alone. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged residents in low-lying areas to leave before mass transit shut down on Saturday. Hospitals and nursing homes in vulnerable zones were also evacuated.  \n\n**Transportation and Infrastructure Disruptions**  \nAmtrak canceled train services south of Washington, D.C., and airports anticipated widespread delays. In Washington, Metro stations prepared for flooding with sandbags, while road crews readied for debris removal. Power companies warned of extended outages, with repair crews mobilizing across the region.  \n\n**Event Cancellations and Delays**  \nThe dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C., originally scheduled for August 28, was postponed due to safety concerns. Colleges delayed student move-ins or sent students home, while beach weddings and vacations were disrupted.  \n\n**Storm Projections and Warnings**  \nForecasters predicted Irene would weaken to a Category 2 storm after hitting North Carolina but warned of life-threatening storm surges (5–10 feet in some areas), heavy rainfall (6–15 inches), and destructive winds (up to 110 mph). The storm’s slow movement increased flooding risks, particularly in the saturated Northeast.  \n\n**Government Response**  \nFEMA pre-positioned supplies, and President Obama declared an emergency in North Carolina. Governors emphasized the storm’s severity, with Maryland’s Martin O’Malley warning against underestimating Irene’s danger.  \n\nAs millions braced for impact, officials stressed preparedness, urging residents to heed evacuation orders and avoid coastal areas.

      "Could it be? A Chinese ship searching for Flight 370 has picked up a ping in the southern Indian Ocean, reports CNN and the BBC. Both cite a report in China's Xinhua news agency. The pulse is 37.5 kHz, the frequency for the Malaysian plane's black-box data recorders, says the president of the beacon's manufacturer. All the reports caution that it could turn out to be yet another false hope, however. \"This could be a variety of things,\" says one oceanographer, noting that the frequency is used by lots of instruments. For the record, the Chinese ship detected the signal at 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, says the state-run Xinhua. \"It is yet to be established whether it is related to the missing jet,\" the report says. The development comes as dozens of ships and planes intensify their sweeps in the search zone, given the finite battery life of the data recorders."

Recent developments include the detection of acoustic signals in the southern Indian Ocean, raising cautious optimism among investigators.  \n\nA Chinese ship, *Haixun 01*, picked up a pulse signal with a frequency of 37.5 kHz—matching that of an aircraft’s flight recorders—on Friday and Saturday. The signal, detected at approximately 25°S latitude and 101°E longitude, lasted about 90 seconds but was not recorded due to its sudden appearance. While Chinese authorities and Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) called it an \"important and encouraging lead,\" they emphasized that no confirmation links it to MH370.  \n\nMeanwhile, the Australian vessel *Ocean Shield*, equipped with advanced U.S. Navy towed pinger locator technology, is investigating a separate acoustic noise in a different area. Up to 10 military planes, two civil aircraft, and 13 ships are assisting in the search across a vast 216,000 sq km area northwest of Perth. White objects spotted near the signal detection site have also drawn attention, though none have been definitively tied to the missing plane.  \n\nExperts remain cautious, noting that false leads have arisen before. The handheld hydrophone used by *Haixun 01* is less sophisticated than the deep-sea equipment on *Ocean Shield*, and the signals’ fleeting nature complicates verification. However, the frequency alignment offers hope, as 37.5 kHz is standard for black box pingers.  \n\nWith the 30-day battery life of the pingers nearing its end, urgency has grown. Malaysia Airlines confirmed the batteries were due for replacement in June 2014. Authorities, including Malaysia’s acting transport minister, have tempered expectations, acknowledging the need for further evidence.  \n\nThe search, now in its most intensive phase, involves international collaboration, including ships like Britain’s *HMS Echo* and new ministerial committees to streamline efforts. While the latest signals could mark a breakthrough, investigators stress that definitive proof is still lacking, and the mystery of MH370’s fate remains unresolved.  \n\n**Word Count: 298** (Fits within one page when formatted appropriately.)",

      "Own a Samsung smart TV? Then take note: Your television is not only listening, it's sending your data to a third party, the Independent reports. The TV's voice-recognition software lets you give it orders, but the product's privacy policy warns that \"personal or other sensitive information ... will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\" Samsung tells the BBC that the third party is Nuance, the company that does Samsung's speech-to-text conversion. But intellectual property lawyer Corynne McSherry says it would be nice to see that clarified in Samsung's policy, the Daily Beast reports. \"And I’d definitely like to know whether my words were being transmitted in a secure form,\" she says. An activist tweets that Samsung's policy sounds a lot like the description of \"telescreens\" in George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984—which reads in part, \"Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by [the screen].\" Unnervingly, it wasn't clear how often \"the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.\" Samsung, however, says it doesn't keep voice data, and customers can opt to turn off voice-recognition or even unplug the TV from Wi-Fi. And Samsung isn't alone: the Verge reports that XBoxes already use voice recognition while being connected to the Internet. \"Samsung's privacy policy is not unique; its rhetoric just happens to be similar to that of a well-known sci-fi novel,\" the Verge says."

While users can disable voice recognition, doing so limits functionality, and Samsung continues collecting usage data (e.g., viewed content, search queries, and device information) to personalize recommendations. The policy has drawn comparisons to George Orwell’s *1984*, with critics likening the always-listening TVs to dystopian surveillance tools. Samsung clarifies that data is encrypted and users can disconnect their TVs from Wi-Fi for added privacy, but concerns persist about the broader implications of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) enabling pervasive data collection.  \n\n**Microsoft Xbox One’s Always-Listening Kinect (Passage 3):**  \nMicrosoft’s Xbox One announcement revealed that its Kinect sensor, bundled with the console, will always listen for voice commands—even when the device is off—to enable features like \"Xbox On.\" The Kinect’s advanced capabilities include detecting heartbeats and recognizing individual voices, raising privacy concerns. Critics analogized the system to *1984*, fearing constant surveillance.

      "The Tesla Model X that slammed into a highway barrier in California last week and killed the 38-year-old Apple engineer at the wheel had been on autopilot at the time of the crash, Tesla confirms in a blog post. But the company says driver Walter Huang \"received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive,\" adding that \"the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\" Tesla also laid some blame on state highway officials, asserting that \"the reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced.\" The fact that the vehicle was on autopilot is likely to be controversial because, as ABC News notes, driver Huang had reportedly been concerned about it. His brother told KGO that Huang had brought his Model X back to the dealership complaining that when he used the feature, the car kept swerving toward the very same barrier that it eventually struck in the fatal collision. The NTSB is investigating the crash, including the fire that broke out after the collision. The accident follows another in Arizona in which a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian."

Investigations by Tesla, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) revealed that the vehicle’s Autopilot system was engaged at the time of the crash. According to Tesla, the driver had received multiple warnings to keep his hands on the wheel, but his hands were not detected for six seconds before the collision. Despite having an unobstructed view of a damaged concrete divider for about five seconds, no corrective action was taken.  \n\nThe severity of the crash was attributed to a missing or crushed crash attenuator—a safety barrier designed to absorb impact—which had been damaged in a prior accident 11 days earlier and not replaced. Tesla emphasized that the Autopilot system generally improves safety, citing statistics that Tesla vehicles with Autopilot are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in fatal accidents compared to other cars. However, Huang’s family revealed that he had repeatedly complained to Tesla dealerships about the Autopilot system veering toward the same barrier before the crash, though technicians could not replicate the issue.  \n\nThe California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) stated that repairs to damaged barriers are typically completed within five to seven business days, but weather delays may occur. Meanwhile, the NTSB recovered vehicle logs and control modules to analyze the crash sequence.  \n\nThe incident has intensified scrutiny over autonomous vehicle safety, following another recent fatality involving an Uber self-driving car in Arizona. Tesla maintains that while Autopilot cannot prevent all accidents, it significantly reduces their likelihood and enhances overall road safety. The company expressed deep condolences to Huang’s family, which includes a wife and two children, while defending the broader safety benefits of autonomous driving technology.  \n\nThis tragedy highlights critical concerns about vehicle automation reliability, infrastructure maintenance, and the need for clearer safety protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

      "Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."

A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, revisits this model with a new perspective. Hooper argues that due to the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy, stars beyond our Local Group will eventually become inaccessible. To avoid isolation, advanced civilizations would need to harvest energy from distant stars before they vanish beyond the cosmic horizon. This could involve using Dyson spheres—swarms of solar-powered satellites—to capture and transport stars. Hooper suggests that such civilizations might already be detectable through unusual electromagnetic signatures or the movement of stars. While humanity is still far from achieving Type I status, older extraterrestrial civilizations could already be at Type III, actively harvesting stars.  \n\n**Passage 2: WARCZone at the Internet Archive**  \nWARCZone is a repository of web archive files (WARCs) uploaded by external contributors to the Internet Archive.

Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

Using Google’s PageRank algorithm—which measures a page’s importance based on incoming links—the study initially produced surprising results. In the English-language Wikipedia, Frank Sinatra ranked as the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when considering all 24 major language editions, Adolf Hitler emerged as the most prominent figure, with Michael Jackson and Madonna following. The study also revealed biases in Wikipedia’s coverage, showing that most highlighted figures are male, from Western countries, and born after the 17th century. Additionally, each language edition tends to emphasize local figures. The researchers adjusted their methodology by incorporating CheiRank (measuring outgoing links) and combining it with PageRank to create 2DRank, which refined their findings. A notable anomaly was Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, who appeared highly influential due to his taxonomic naming system, which generates countless Wikipedia links.  \n\n**Passage 2** shifts focus to the Internet Archive’s efforts to combat broken links on the web through its \"No More 404\" initiative. The project involves archiving web pages and their referenced links to preserve the original content even if the source pages are altered or removed. The goal is to replace broken links with archived versions, ensuring long-term accessibility and maintaining the integrity of online references.  \n\n**Passage 3** revisits the study by Young-Ho Eom, delving deeper into the concept of intellectual influence. Using Wikipedia’s link structure, the research identified Carl Linnaeus as the most influential figure across all language editions, surpassing historical giants like Hitler, Jesus, and Newton. Linnaeus’s prominence stems from his taxonomy system, which generates extensive Wikipedia references. The passage contrasts this finding with another study by Jasleen Kaur and colleagues, which measured academic influence through citation analysis and ranked Karl Marx as history’s most influential scholar.  \n\n**Key Takeaways:**  \n1. Wikipedia’s structure can skew perceptions of influence, favoring figures like Linnaeus due to taxonomic links.  \n2.

      "The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""

While Philadelphia authorities took a more restrained approach, Los Angeles police declared an unlawful assembly and threatened arrests, though full-scale evictions were delayed.  \n\nIn **Philadelphia**, around 100 protesters remained at Dilworth Plaza near City Hall past Mayor Michael Nutter’s 5 p.m. Sunday deadline. Despite expectations of police intervention, officers held back, with Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan emphasizing cooperation and nonviolence. Protesters, many of whom were homeless, dismantled about a third of the 300 tents voluntarily. The city cited upcoming renovations—including a $50 million project to transform the plaza—as the reason for the eviction. Demonstrators, such as unemployed counselor Darrin Annussek, criticized corporate greed and questioned the mayor’s health and safety justifications. Supporters like Ellen Rogovinhart urged peaceful resolution, hoping Philadelphia would avoid the violent clashes seen in other cities.  \n\nMeanwhile, in **Los Angeles**, police declared an unlawful assembly early Monday after Occupy L.A. protesters ignored a midnight deadline to leave City Hall Park. Officers in riot gear lined the streets, warning demonstrators to disperse or face arrest. Though four arrests were made for unlawful assembly, police initially refrained from clearing the camp, delaying enforcement until at least daybreak. The encampment, one of the largest in the nation with 400 tents and up to 800 people, had drawn support from labor and civil rights groups. Protesters briefly clashed with police, chanting and throwing debris, but the confrontation remained largely nonviolent. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa praised the movement’s message but insisted it was time to vacate the park. Some protesters, like organizer Clark Davis, acknowledged police restraint.  \n\nBoth cities reflected the broader Occupy movement’s struggle to balance protest rights with urban order. While Philadelphia’s approach leaned toward negotiation, Los Angeles edged closer to enforcement, though neither saw the violent crackdowns reported elsewhere. Legal challenges, including a federal injunction request in L.A., underscored the tension between civil liberties and municipal authority. The protests highlighted ongoing discontent with economic inequality, corporate influence, and government responsiveness, leaving the future of the movement uncertain as cities sought to reclaim public spaces.  \n\n(Word count: 298",

      "A Texas woman was caught on surveillance video stealing a wedding ring off the finger of a dead woman Friday, the Odessa American reports. The body of Lois Hicks, 88, was in an open casket at Odessa's Sunset Funeral Home. The woman's family had just left the funeral home after a visitation service when a stranger parked outside, came in, and asked to use the restroom. Instead, the funeral home's manager says, she walked into the room with Hicks' coffin, grabbed the ring off her finger, and left. Hicks' daughter says some of her mother's skin was actually torn off during the theft. \"I can't believe someone would be that low,\" she says. The surveillance video captured the alleged thief's license plate, and the family is pressing charges. The incident is being investigated as a felony, KOSA reports.

The suspect, captured on surveillance video, is described as a heavy-set white female wearing a brown long-sleeve sweater, black sweatpants, and black sandals. She fled the scene in a red or maroon four-door Saturn. Authorities have released higher-quality video footage and a photo of the suspect’s vehicle, urging the public to contact Odessa Crime Stoppers (432-333-TIPS) with any information. The crime is being investigated as a State Jail Felony, and no arrests have been made.  \n\nThe victim, 88-year-old Lois Hicks, had recently passed away, and her family was devastated by the theft. Her daughter, Vel McKee, recounted how the suspect entered the funeral home after visitation hours, pretending to ask for the restroom before stealing the ring from Hicks’ hand—an act so violent it tore part of the skin from her finger. The ring held deep sentimental value, symbolizing Hicks’ marriage to her late husband, Gayle, who died three years prior. McKee expressed shock and disgust, stating, “I can’t believe someone would be that low.”  \n\nBill Vallie, the funeral home’s general manager, confirmed that surveillance footage showed the suspect entering alone and acting suspiciously. While theft from the deceased is not unheard of, Vallie emphasized the brazenness of this incident, noting it was the first such occurrence at the funeral home since it opened in 1999. The family hopes enhanced images of the suspect’s license plate will lead to an arrest and plans to press charges.  \n\nThe Hicks family, still grieving their loss, is heartbroken by the violation.

      "Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture. (Scientists have grown chickens with dinosaur legs.)"

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nRecent research has challenged the popular depiction of dinosaurs as roaring creatures, suggesting instead that they may have produced closed-mouth vocalizations similar to modern birds. Studies indicate that large-bodied dinosaurs likely emitted low-frequency sounds, such as coos or booms, using inflating throat sacs rather than open-mouthed roars (Passages 1, 4, and 5). This behavior, observed in birds like doves and ostriches, has evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs—a group that includes birds, crocodiles, and dinosaurs. The findings imply that Hollywood’s iconic T. rex roar, created from mixed animal sounds like baby elephants and tigers, is inaccurate (Passages 1 and 2).  \n\nSound designers for *Jurassic Park* relied on creative combinations of animal noises to bring dinosaurs to life. For example, velociraptor barks came from mating tortoises, while the T. rex’s roar incorporated slowed-down sounds from a Jack Russell terrier and a baby elephant (Passage 2). However, scientists argue that real dinosaur vocalizations were likely less dramatic, resembling the closed-mouth hoots of ostriches or cassowaries (Passages 1 and 5).  \n\nThe research highlights gaps in our understanding of dinosaur sounds, as vocal organs—composed of soft tissue—rarely fossilize. Despite this, the study of living archosaurs provides clues. Closed-mouth vocalizations are linked to courtship and territorial displays, suggesting dinosaurs may have used similar sounds for communication (Passages 4 and 5).  \n\nAdditionally, the *Jurassic Park* sound team revealed behind-the-scenes details, such as using geese for raptor hisses and donkeys for brachiosaurus calls (Passage 2). Meanwhile, unrelated web archives (Passage 3) were included in the provided materials but did not contribute to the scientific discussion.  \n\nOverall, the evidence paints a quieter, more nuanced picture of dinosaur vocalizations, emphasizing their evolutionary connection to birds and underscoring the speculative nature of their sounds in popular media. As paleontologists continue to investigate, the study of living species remains key to reconstructing the acoustic world of the distant past.  \n\n(Word count: 300)",

      "A white-collar crook is facing extra prison time for having his son shoot him in the legs with a 20-gauge shotgun, the BBC reports. Shannon Egeland, 43, was already facing 10 years for taking part in a vast mortgage-fraud scheme when he had his 17-year-old son shoot him by a road in Caldwell, Idaho, in an attempt to avoid prison. \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,\" US attorney Scott Bradford wrote in a sentencing memo. Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle. Facing prison, Egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs. Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't.

The staged shooting, which led to the amputation of his left leg, was intended to delay his prison sentence and fraudulently claim disability insurance benefits.  \n\nEgeland, a former co-owner of Desert Sun, a housing development company, had previously pleaded guilty to defrauding banks through falsified loan applications in a scheme that rocked Central Oregon in 2009.

Egeland then falsely reported to authorities that he had been assaulted while helping a pregnant motorist.  \n\nProsecutors described Egeland as a \"menace to society\" and a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist\" who manipulated his son for personal gain.

      "With George HW Bush dead at 94, coverage of the life of the 41st president is plentiful. Here are some early highlights: The broad strokes: For a thorough obituary and assessment, start with the Washington Post. Its story notes that while Bush served just one term as president, it was a consequential one. \"The Berlin Wall fell; the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the communist bloc in Eastern Europe broke up; the Cold War ended.\" And Bush's \"firm, restrained diplomatic sense helped assure the harmony and peace with which these world-shaking events played out, one after the other.\" Great detail: In its obituary, the Wall Street Journal notes that Bush flew 58 missions in the Pacific as a Navy pilot in WWII, all with the name of his girlfriend—Barbara—on the side of the plane. He once got shot down, with this video capturing the rescue. Bush is also the only American besides John Adams to be both president and the father of a president. Read his lips: The Guardian recounts some of his Bush's famous quotes, including his \"read my lips\" pledge to not raise taxes. He also dissed broccoli."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe provided news passages primarily focus on the life, career, and legacy of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who passed away at the age of 94.  \n\n**Passage 1** details Bush’s extensive political career, from his service in World War II as the Navy’s youngest pilot to his presidency (1989–1993). Key achievements include leading the U.S. to victory in the Gulf War, overseeing the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union, and facilitating German reunification. Despite these successes, his presidency was marred by economic recession and a broken \"no new taxes\" pledge, leading to his 1992 loss to Bill Clinton. Post-presidency, Bush remained active in diplomacy and formed an unlikely friendship with Clinton. The passage also highlights his family’s political legacy, including his son George W. Bush’s presidency.  \n\n**Passage 2** compiles notable quotes from Bush’s career, illustrating his leadership style and values. These include his 1988 \"Read my lips: No new taxes\" pledge (later broken), his advocacy for freedom during the fall of the Berlin Wall, and his humorous disdain for broccoli. Other quotes reflect his diplomatic approach, such as his defense of Clarence Thomas’s Supreme Court nomination and his post-presidency collaboration with Clinton on humanitarian efforts.  \n\n**Passage 3** is unrelated to Bush, instead describing a web archive collection curated by Mark Graham through the Internet Archive’s Archive-IT service, focusing on ISKME.org and IGC.org.  \n\n**Key Themes**:  \n- George H.W.

      "Unnamed officials say TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes at LAX before being taken to an ambulance. For 28 of those minutes, alleged shooter Paul Ciancia was in police custody, though officers hadn't yet declared the area safe to enter. Officers checked on Hernandez, who was just 20 feet from an exit, then moved on while paramedics waited 150 yards away, the AP reports, noting it's not clear if immediate attention might have saved Hernandez's life. Now under review: the conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter, and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier. While an officer who checked on Hernandez about 5 minutes after he was shot told numerous officers he was dead, the AP reports that it's not known whether that officer had the training needed to make that determination; no first-aid was administered. \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" an LAX employee says. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" The results of the investigation could be months away, the AP adds.

The alleged gunman, 23-year-old Paul Ciancia, entered Terminal 3 with an assault rifle and opened fire, specifically targeting TSA employees. Authorities later found a note in his bag expressing his intent to \"kill TSA\" and criticizing their security procedures. Ciancia was shot four times by airport police and taken into custody. His condition was later upgraded from critical to fair at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. He faces charges, including murder, which could carry the death penalty.\n\nThe incident revealed critical lapses in emergency response coordination. Despite Ciancia being subdued and in custody within five minutes of the shooting, paramedics were delayed for 33 minutes before reaching Hernandez, who lay bleeding just 20 feet from an exit. Law enforcement officials are investigating whether earlier medical intervention could have saved Hernandez, who was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. Surveillance footage showed no officers administering first aid, and a veteran LAPD officer repeatedly declared Hernandez dead at the scene, though it remains unclear if he was qualified to make that assessment. \n\nThe tragedy has raised concerns about the lack of coordination between police and fire departments during active shooter situations. Victor Payes, a TSA union representative, criticized the disjointed response, suggesting Hernandez might have survived with better coordination. While protocols have evolved since the 1999 Columbine shooting—emphasizing immediate police engagement—training and compliance gaps persist. A recent audit found that the LAPD had a 0% compliance rate for mandatory first aid refresher courses, though airport police had received such training. \n\nMeanwhile, a public memorial honored Hernandez, the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty.

      "Kim Jong Nam's assassins killed him with a banned chemical weapon, Malaysian police revealed Friday. The country's police chief said toxicology reports on swabs from the face and eyes of the exiled North Korean found VX nerve agent, which the BBC notes is classed as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated. North Korea—which is widely suspected to have been behind the killing of leader Kim Jong Un's half brother—never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention that banned VX, the AP notes. Pyongyang denies involvement and says Malaysia's investigation is full of \"holes and contradictions.\" The father of one of the two women being held, Vietnamese citizen Doan Thi Huong, tells the Times his daughter trained as a pharmacist and he has seen little of her in recent years. (Police say that after Malaysia refused to give Kim's body to North Korean diplomats, somebody tried to break into the morgue.)"

On February 13, 2017, Kim Jong-nam was attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by two women who wiped a toxic substance on his face. Malaysian authorities later confirmed that the lethal chemical used was **VX nerve agent**, a banned weapon of mass destruction under the UN Chemical Weapons Convention.  \n\n### **Key Details of the Attack**  \n- **Method**: The assailants, an Indonesian and a Vietnamese woman, allegedly smeared VX on Kim’s face. One of the women later fell ill with vomiting, suggesting exposure to the toxin.  \n- **Effects of VX**: The nerve agent, odorless and tasteless, causes rapid death by disrupting the nervous system. Even a minuscule amount can be fatal within minutes.  \n- **Public Safety Concerns**: Authorities delayed decontaminating the airport for 11 days, raising fears of lingering contamination, as VX can persist like motor oil. However, no other illnesses were reported among airport staff or passengers.  \n\n### **North Korea’s Involvement and Denial**  \nNorth Korea, which has not acknowledged the victim as Kim Jong-nam, vehemently denies involvement and accuses Malaysia of conspiring with South Korea to frame Pyongyang. The North Korean Jurists Committee even blamed Malaysia for the death, citing its failure to protect a foreign national, and hinted at its nuclear capabilities in a thinly veiled threat.  \n\n### **North Korea’s Chemical Weapons Capability**  \n- North Korea is suspected of possessing **2,500–5,000 tons** of chemical weapons, including VX, sarin, and mustard gas.  \n- It is one of six nations not party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and is believed capable of producing up to **12,000 tons annually** during crises.  \n- Experts suggest North Korea could deploy such weapons globally using unconventional methods and has shared chemical weapons technology with countries like Syria and Iran.  \n\n### **Diplomatic Fallout**  \nMalaysia’s investigation has strained relations with North Korea, which has demanded the return of Kim’s body and accused Malaysian officials of lying.

      "Earlier this year, President Trump noted \"I just don't want a poor person\" in charge of economic posts in his administration, then touted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as \"a very rich person\" who was up to the task. But just how rich Ross really is is now up in the air, Forbes reports, noting it's yanked Ross off its billionaires list after a one-month probe revealed that $2 billion or so or Ross' alleged fortune \"never existed,\" and that Ross had engaged in an \"apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications, and whoppers\" with the magazine going back 13 years. The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

Ross, who had long been listed on the Forbes 400, allegedly misrepresented his wealth by including investor funds as his own. After his nomination to President Trump’s cabinet, Ross’s financial disclosures revealed less than $700 million in assets, contradicting his earlier claims.

      "Oil giant BP lost $5.2 billion last year, but the company somehow saw fit to propose maximum bonuses for 2015 for its top executives, including a 20% pay increase for CEO Bob Dudley—a proposal that 59% of shareholders roundly rejected by proxy vote at Thursday's annual meeting, MarketWatch reports. The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report. This amount was bumped up from the $3 million ($1 million in cash) he received in 2014. BP's CFO was also on the list to rake in his full bonus. \"We think it sends the wrong message,\" a rep for shareholder Royal London Asset Management tells the BBC. \"It shows that the board is out of touch.\" Not only did BP suffer straight-up monetary losses as the price of oil fell, it also announced it will be getting rid of about 7,000 jobs and taking other belt-tightening measures. And the Financial Times notes that other energy company execs saw their pay slashed in 2015. But a BP spokesman says \"executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable.\" Andy Critchlow, writing for the Reuters Breakingviews blog, agrees. \"Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors,\" he writes, noting the CEO has helped the company recover from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and improved safety protocol. \"The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.\" Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP's board, says the nonbinding shareholder vote won't alter the payouts they've already decided on, but that the board will take investors' concerns into account when coming up with next year's compensation packages."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages on BP’s Executive Pay Controversy**  \n\nThe news articles detail the backlash against BP’s decision to award CEO Bob Dudley a 20% pay increase in 2015, raising his total compensation to $19.6 million, despite the company reporting a $5.2 billion loss and cutting thousands of jobs due to falling oil prices. Shareholders, advisory firms, and institutional investors expressed strong opposition, culminating in a historic non-binding vote at BP’s annual general meeting, where 59% of shareholders rejected the pay package—one of the largest rebellions against executive pay in UK corporate history.  \n\n**Key Points:**  \n1. **Justification for Pay Increase**: BP defended Dudley’s raise, citing his performance in improving safety, reducing spills, and managing the fallout from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. The company argued he met or exceeded operational targets, including cash flow and project timelines.  \n2. **Shareholder Opposition**: Advisory firms like Glass Lewis and ISS criticized the payouts as misaligned with BP’s financial performance. Investors, including Royal London Asset Management, called the decision \"out of touch,\" especially as peers like Shell’s CEO took pay cuts.  \n3. **Broader Trend**: The revolt reflects growing shareholder activism globally, with similar protests at firms like Smith & Nephew and U.S. banks. Critics argue executive pay often remains high despite poor company performance.  \n4. **BP’s Response**: Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg acknowledged shareholder concerns and pledged to review pay policies but confirmed Dudley’s 2015 package would not be clawed back. The board emphasized that the pay formula was approved by 96% of shareholders in 2014.  \n5. **Market Context**: While Dudley’s pay was lower than some U.S. oil executives’, it exceeded European peers. Analysts noted the difficulty of comparing global pay structures, with Shell’s CEO’s 2014 package inflated by one-time pension payments.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The backlash highlights tensions over executive compensation in times of crisis, with shareholders demanding greater accountability. BP’s pledge to revisit its pay policy signals a potential shift, but the vote underscores the need for boards to align rewards with company performance. The outcome may influence broader corporate governance reforms, particularly in the UK, where regulators threaten stricter rules if boards ignore investor concerns.  \n\n(Word count: 298)",

      "Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)"

Crotty Alexander and her team at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine has revealed that cigarette smoke exacerbates the virulence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA). Published in *Infection and Immunity*, the study demonstrates that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes significantly more resistant to immune defenses, making infections harder to treat.  \n\nMRSA, a life-threatening superbug, causes severe skin, bloodstream, and surgical site infections, as well as pneumonia. The study found that smoke-exposed MRSA strains were more resilient against macrophages—immune cells that engulf and destroy bacteria. These bacteria resisted reactive oxygen species (chemical bursts used by macrophages) and antimicrobial peptides (which puncture bacterial cell walls). Additionally, smoke-treated MRSA adhered more effectively to human cells, enhancing its invasive potential. The resistance was dose-dependent, with higher smoke exposure leading to greater bacterial resilience.  \n\nA related study by the same team examined e-cigarette vapor’s effects, finding similar but less severe resistance in MRSA compared to traditional cigarette smoke. While both altered bacterial cell walls, cigarette smoke induced a tenfold greater increase in resistance.  \n\nFurther experiments in mice and human cells confirmed that smoke-exposed MRSA caused higher mortality rates and remained resistant for up to 24 hours post-exposure, suggesting potential hereditary resistance. This finding is alarming given MRSA’s rapid reproduction rate, which could lead to widespread resistant strains.  \n\nThe research challenges the conventional view that smoking harms only the smoker, showing it also strengthens pathogens. Dr. Crotty Alexander emphasized that smokers face dual risks: compromised immune responses and more aggressive bacterial infections. The study underscores the urgent need for smoking cessation to curb the rise of treatment-resistant superbugs.  \n\nFunded in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, this work highlights a critical public health concern, adding to the growing evidence against smoking and its broader societal impact.  \n\n**Key Takeaways:**  \n1. Cigarette smoke makes MRSA more resistant to immune defenses and antibiotics.  \n2. Smoke-exposed MRSA is deadlier in mice and adheres better to human cells.  \n3.

The incident began as a dispute in the valet area of the Aria resort before escalating into gunfire between occupants of a black Range Rover SUV and a silver-gray Maserati. Witnesses reported that the Range Rover, with tinted windows, custom rims, and paper dealer plates, pursued the Maserati onto Las Vegas Boulevard, where shots were fired at a stoplight near Flamingo Road.  \n\nThe Maserati, struck by gunfire, crashed into a taxi, causing an explosion that killed the taxi driver, Michael Boldon, and his passenger. The Maserati’s driver, Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr., an aspiring rapper known as \"Kenny Clutch,\" also died. A passenger in the Maserati survived with gunshot wounds. The Range Rover fled the scene, prompting a multi-state manhunt. Police clarified that the shooting was not a \"rolling gun battle\" but a targeted attack, with gunfire originating solely from the SUV.  \n\nThe aftermath disrupted traffic and pedestrian access near major casinos like Bellagio and Caesars Palace, with crime scene investigations lasting hours. Authorities reviewed surveillance footage and witness accounts but had not yet determined the motive. The incident marked the latest in a series of violent episodes on the Strip in early 2013, including a parking garage shooting and a stabbing.  \n\nCommunity reactions varied, with tourists expressing shock and locals emphasizing Las Vegas’s generally safe reputation. The Professional Drivers Association pledged support for Boldon’s family, while law enforcement reassured the public that the violence was isolated. The case drew comparisons to the unsolved 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur, which occurred nearby.  \n\nAs investigations continued, the tragedy underscored the unpredictability of violence in high-traffic tourist areas, leaving both residents and visitors grappling with its impact.  \n\n*(Word count: 298)*",

      "The three American hikers detained by Iran weren’t captured in Iraq, says Sarah Shourd: They were beckoned over the border by an armed soldier, she tells the New York Times in an effort to set the WikiLeaks version of the story straight. “We did not actually enter Iran until he gestured to us. We were confused and worried and wanted to go back.\" In Shourd's fullest account of her ordeal to date, she goes into detail about their fateful overnight camping trip, describing \"scores of campfires\" near the waterfall they were hiking to—which abutted Iran. “I think we were extremely unlucky,” says Shourd. “I guess I never believed there would be so many hundreds of people close to a border.” Her interview with the Times comes ahead of a court date for her fellow hikers, which was set for Saturday but has been delayed by Iran until Shourd “can return to Iran or,” if she refuses, her case can “be dealt with differently,” said an Iranian official. But her lawyer says the trial should go forward; neither he nor Shourd, he tells Reuters, were notified of the change."

The case has become a focal point in the strained relations between the U.S. and Iran.  \n\n### **Delayed Trial and Legal Proceedings**  \nIran postponed the trial of Bauer and Fattal, citing the absence of Shourd, who was released on $500,000 bail in September 2010 due to health concerns and returned to the U.S. Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei stated that the trial could not proceed without Shourd, suggesting she must return or face separate legal action. However, their lawyer, Masoud Shafiee, disputed the delay, claiming no official notice was given. The trial’s postponement coincides with U.S. and international efforts to restart nuclear negotiations with Iran.  \n\n### **Controversy Over Arrest and U.S. Response**  \nThe hikers maintain they accidentally crossed into Iran while hiking in Iraq’s Kurdish region, unaware of the border. A leaked U.S. military report suggested they may have intentionally provoked the situation, but Shourd dismissed this as baseless, stating they had no warning and no intent to agitate. The U.S. State Department, represented by Philip J. Crowley, affirmed uncertainty about the arrest details but condemned Iran’s prolonged detention of the hikers.  \n\n### **Prisoner Swap Speculation and Broader Tensions**  \nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad previously hinted at a potential prisoner exchange involving Iranians detained in the U.S., including Shahrazad Mir Gholikhan, who alleged torture in American custody. Meanwhile, Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful but has delayed setting a date for renewed talks, further complicating diplomatic relations.  \n\n### **Hikers’ Account of Events**  \nShourd described their trip as an innocent camping excursion in Kurdistan, with no awareness of the nearby border. After being detained by Iranian guards, they were imprisoned in Tehran’s Evin Prison, where Bauer and Fattal remain. Shourd attributed their arrest to bad luck rather than negligence.  \n\nThe case underscores the broader geopolitical tensions between Iran and the U.S., intertwining legal, humanitarian, and diplomatic challenges.",

These loans, such as 1-hour or 2-hour no-credit-check options, provide quick access to funds for emergencies like medical bills, utility payments, or unexpected expenses. However, the convenience comes at a cost—high interest rates and fees, especially if the loan is not repaid on time. The article warns against predatory lenders and emphasizes the importance of understanding repayment terms to avoid excessive debt.  \n\nApplicants can apply online with minimal formalities, and approval is often quick, even for those with poor credit histories. The loans typically range from £80 to £1,500 and must be repaid in installments over a short period (one to four weeks). Eligibility criteria include being a UK resident over 18 years old, employed with a minimum monthly income of £1,000, and having an active bank account. The passage encourages borrowers to use these loans responsibly and only for urgent needs.  \n\n**Passage 2: Jay’s Love for Cars**  \nThe second passage is a lighthearted piece focusing on Jay’s passion for automobiles. It invites readers to explore and share their favorite cars, suggesting an appreciation for beautiful and unique vehicles. Unlike the first passage, this one is not informational but rather engaging, aiming to spark conversation among car enthusiasts.  \n\n**Overall Summary**  \nThe two news passages cover vastly different topics.

Police in the small city of Medicine Hat say Steve Vogelsang robbed a Royal Bank of Canada on Thursday, Oct. 19, and then turned around the next day and robbed a Bank of Montreal, CBC reports. He entered both banks without a disguise and after demanding money, left with an undisclosed sum. Police finally arrested Vogelsang at a nearby hotel at around 3am on Saturday. Per CTV Winnipeg News, Vogelsang, 53, was a longtime news director and sports broadcaster at CKY, now CTV Winnipeg. He also taught journalism at Red River College in Winnipeg from 2002 to 2011. Conor Lloyd, a spokesman for the college, says, “I can confirm he is no longer an employee here.” Vogelsang is scheduled to appear in provincial court on Tuesday."

The incidents occurred on October 19 and 20, 2023, at a Royal Bank of Canada and a Bank of Montreal, where a suspect passed notes to tellers and left with undisclosed amounts of cash. Vogelsang was arrested without incident at a Medicine Hat hotel on October 21 and remains in custody awaiting court proceedings.  \n\nVogelsang, a well-known media personality, worked as a sports anchor and news director at CTV Winnipeg (formerly CKY) from the early 1990s until 2002. He later taught journalism at Red River College from 2002 to 2011, briefly returning on a part-time basis after moving back to Winnipeg in 2014. The college confirmed he is no longer employed there.  \n\nThe charges add to a series of personal and legal troubles for Vogelsang. Court documents reveal financial struggles, including mortgage defaults, property losses totaling $85,000, and allegations of forging his ex-wife’s signature on loan documents. His Winnipeg home was foreclosed in April 2023, and he reportedly lived in his vehicle at times.  \n\nAdditionally, Vogelsang faces allegations of harassment from a former student he dated intermittently since 2004. She obtained a protection order in March 2023, accusing him of persistent unwanted contact despite police warnings. Vogelsang denies the claims, stating she misled authorities to damage his reputation. He also previously faced a stayed sexual assault charge from 2016 and is scheduled to address three counts of disobeying court orders in 2024.  \n\nFormer students expressed shock at the allegations, remembering Vogelsang as a dedicated but demanding instructor. Police emphasize that while no weapon was seen in the robberies, the note-passing tactic implies an implied threat.

Adams, who voluntarily presented himself for questioning, was detained for four days at Antrim Police Station before being released without charge. Police confirmed that a file on the case will be sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) to determine whether charges should be filed.  \n\nJean McConville, a widowed mother of ten, was abducted from her Belfast home, murdered, and secretly buried by the IRA after being falsely accused of being a British informant.

He described the allegations as part of a \"malicious campaign\" and maintained his innocence, reaffirming Sinn Féin’s commitment to the peace process.

Earlier, Ivor Bell, a former IRA leader, was charged in connection with the case based on these recordings.  \n\nAs tensions flared, loyalist protesters blocked the police station, and minor disturbances were reported in Belfast.

Paramedics were called but the 49-year-old was bleeding profusely and died at the scene. Police say the Canadian-born hairstylist's 2008 Porsche 911 Carrera was missing from the scene and they believe it was stolen by two men who broke into the upscale Woodland Hills home and attacked Sementilli.

Sementilli gained international recognition during his 30 years as a hairstylist and also served as an exec at companies including Wella, the Los Angeles Daily News reports. He was \"recognized as an exceptional stylist, educator, and visionary,\" Wella said in a statement that describes him as \"an icon in the hairdressing industry.\" A post at Modern Salon says he was a VP of education for cosmetics company Coty, adding that he \"mentored tens of thousands of hairdressers with a hands-on approach either on a one-to-one basis or on a grander scale.\" (This man was murdered just two months after President Obama commuted his sentence.)"

      "Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further. Netflix announced yesterday that it is upping the ante, offering new parents unlimited, fully-paid maternity and paternity leave for the first year after having or adopting a child. The streaming video company based in Los Gatos, Calif., also offers unlimited paid vacation, and it's all toward fostering \"a 'freedom and responsibility' culture that gives our employees context about our business and the freedom to make their own decisions along with the accompanying responsibility,\" writes Tawni Cranz, chief talent officer. The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

The terror group had just enslaved and massacred Yazidis by the thousand in nearby Sinjar. Now Jumaah and family were planning to flee to the mountains. \"I had no hope at all,\" says Jumaah, per the Local. \"I was desperate.\" But Turner took action. She spoke to Lund University's then-security chief, who contacted a company that sent mercenaries into northern Iraq.

This feature aims to provide context to tweets while maintaining user control over privacy.  \n\n**Passage 2: Twitter’s Response to Online Abuse**  \nTwitter has pledged to strengthen its policies following severe harassment incidents, including the bullying of Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, after her father’s death. Trolls sent her abusive messages and manipulated images, prompting her to leave Twitter and Instagram. Twitter suspended the offending accounts and announced plans to improve policies on self-harm, private information, and support for families of deceased users.  \n\nHowever, critics argue that Twitter’s existing tools are insufficient to combat persistent harassment. Imani Gandy, a legal analyst, shared her experience of relentless abuse tied to her race, gender, and health, noting that Twitter often fails to act on reports, even for violent threats like rape. While Twitter introduced a \"Report Abuse\" button after a similar incident in 2013, harassers easily circumvent blocks by creating new accounts.  \n\nActivists like Soraya Chemaly argue that Twitter’s emphasis on free speech overlooks the safety of vulnerable users. Suggestions for improvement include adopting third-party tools like \"Block Together,\" which automates blocking and shares block lists among users.

      "The FBI is reportedly investigating a sophisticated—but unsuccessful—attempt to hack into the Democratic National Committee's voter database. The DNC learned of the attempt on Tuesday, CNN reports. The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."

    "llm_answers": "**Summary of News Passages**  \n\nThe news reports highlight ongoing concerns about cybersecurity threats targeting U.S. political systems, particularly as the midterm elections approach. Initially, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) suspected a sophisticated hacking attempt on its voter database, which it described as containing highly sensitive information. The DNC, along with a cloud service provider and a security research firm, detected a fake login page mimicking the party’s Votebuilder access portal—a potential phishing attempt to steal credentials. The incident prompted the DNC to contact the FBI, emphasizing the persistent threats facing election infrastructure.  \n\nHowever, the DNC later clarified that the suspected hack was actually an unauthorized \"simulated phishing test,\" not a genuine attack. Despite this, cybersecurity experts and officials remain on high alert due to the broader landscape of election-related cyber threats. Rob Joyce, former White House cybersecurity coordinator, noted that cyber operations have evolved from espionage to tools of national power, underscoring the vulnerabilities in voter-registration systems, political parties, and think tanks.  \n\nMicrosoft recently reported that Russian intelligence-linked hackers targeted the U.S. Senate and conservative think tanks using fake websites. Additionally, Facebook uncovered disinformation campaigns aimed at influencing global audiences, including potential disruptions to the midterms. These incidents illustrate how foreign actors continue to exploit digital platforms for manipulation.  \n\nIn summary, while the DNC’s recent scare turned out to be a false alarm, the reports collectively emphasize the heightened risks of cyberattacks and disinformation in the electoral process. Officials urge vigilance to safeguard democratic institutions from both foreign and domestic interference.",
